We are organizing a workshop on February 19th and 20th, 1996 to
discuss the the formation of a form for parallel and sparse
BLAS.
This will be a follow on to the discussions that took place
On November 13th and 14th, 52 people attended a Workshop on
Parallel BLAS and Related Interfaces at the Univertsity of Tennessee
and the birds of a feather session that took place at the Supercomputer
95 meting in San Diego in December.



<p>

The existing BLAS have proven to be very effective in assisting portable,
efficient software for sequential and some of the current class
of high-performance computers.  
We would like to investigate the
possibility of extending these standards to provide greater coverage
of sparse matrices and provide additional facilities for parallel computing.
<p>

The purpose of this meeting is to
review the findings of the Workshop in November and the BOF
at the Supercomputer 95 confernece and to
begin a forum to
develop calling sequences for a set of low-level computational kernels
for the parallel and sequential settings, as well as standards for
basic matrix data structures, both dense and sparse.
