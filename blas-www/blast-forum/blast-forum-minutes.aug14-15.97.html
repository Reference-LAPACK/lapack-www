<LI>Twenty people attended the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/blast-forum.html">BLAST Forum</a> in Portland, OR on
February 27-28, 1997.  The meeting was hosted by Intel Corporation.

<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the meeting by welcoming everyone and inviting
everyone to introduce themselves.  He then reviewed the ``rules of
order'' for the first and second readings of proposals, as well as the
voting procedures for the meeting.  The strategy for dividing the
attendees into breakout sessions was then discussed.  A poll was taken
to see how many attendees were interested in each of the proposed
sessions.</P>
<P>
It was decided that discussion of the ``BLAS Extensions'' and ``C
Interface to the Legacy BLAS'' would be combined into one group.
Discussion of the ``BLAS Lite/Thin'' and ``Environmental routines''
would similarly be combined.</P>
<P>
It was then decided to have a brief discussion of the unified BLAS
document, which was prepared by Puri and Sven over the past two days
prior to the meeting.  The structure/presentation of the document was
a topic of lively debate.  About half of the attendees preferred a
unified document for the BLAST proposal instead of separate
``proposals'' or stand-alone chapters.  The proposed document format
(accepted by vote of the forum at the previous meeting) primarily
contains separate chapters on functionality, language independent
specifications, and language binding issues.  Interleaved in these
sections would be information pertaining to the sequential, sparse,
parallel, etc.  However, several attendees voiced concern at this
interleaved proposal idea instead of self-contained chapters.
Specifically, if a user or vendor is only interested in information
pertaining to the sparse BLAS, he or she would still need to read the
entire document.  As the debate continued, it was decided to continue
the discussion after the break-out sessions.</P>
<P>
The following discussion groups met in the morning session:</P>
<UL>
<LI>BLAS Functionality -- Sven Hammarling
<LI>BLAS Extensions and C interface to the Legacy BLAS -- Susan
    Blackford and Clint Whaley
<LI>Sparse BLAS -- Roldan Pozo
<LI>Language binding issues -- Andrew Lumsdaine
</UL>
<P>
After lunch, the following discussion groups met for the afternoon
session:</P>
<UL>
<LI>BLAS Lite and Environmental Routines -- Tony Skjellum and Jack
    Dongarra
<LI>Parallel BLAS -- Antoine Petitet
<LI>Interval BLAS -- Chenyi Hu
</UL>

<HR>
<P>
At 3:00pm, a plenary presentation of the results of the day's break-out
sessions occurred.</P>
<P>
The BLAS Functionality session decided that the justification/priority
column of the tables will be deleted and instead the justification for
each routine will be included in the text of the document.  The tables
referring specifically to Sparse BLAS functionality will be deferred
to the Sparse BLAS chapter/proposal.  The first reading of the
Functionality chapter/proposal will occur at the next meeting.</P>
<P>
The Legacy BLAS session decided that the chapter/proposal will include
the C interface to the BLAS, the Fortran90 interface to the BLAS, and
the extensions to the BLAS.  These latter two sections will be added
to the Legacy BLAS chapter in order to increase the number of
short-term deliverables, and will be available for a first reading at
the next meeting.  The ``Extensions'' list will be kept as short as
possible.  Vendors were asked to provide a list of BLAS extensions
that they have incorporated into their optimized BLAS libraries in
order to see some commonality of needs in the vendor's applications
community.  Multiple instance routines will not be included as part of
the extensions to the BLAS, and will instead be discussed as part of
the ``New BLAS'' in a separate section of the proposal. The C
interface to the BLAS was also discussed section by section in
preparation for the first reading later in the meeting.  A ``row
major'' and a ``column major'' interface will be provided, and
character arguments will be handled as enumerated types.  The only
topics of contention were Section 5.1.4 ``Handling of complex data
types'', and Section 5.1.5 ``Return values of complex functions''.
Compatibility with the C9X standard effort was stressed.</P>
<P>
When the Sparse BLAS chapter/proposal was addressed, a first reading
of the document was suggested as their were no ``new'' decisions made
at the break-out session, merely re-explaining of some previous design
decisions, and some suggestions to make the presentation of the
document clearer.  This first reading suggestion was opposed as
several attendees felt that the user interface issue had not been
fully addressed.  Thus, the language binding issue of free format or
``data neutral'' versus specific data formats for the user interface
of the software was addressed.  The ``data-neutral'' user level
interface is not necessarily meant to replace the ``concrete
routines'' that are already in place, but can be viewed as an opaque
interface whereby someone else can implement their specific data
formats.  This is exactly what Iain Duff proposed with the User Level
Sparse BLAS and the issue may be addressed (if there is interest).</P>
<P>
The Language Bindings discussion centered on a handle-based language
interface, whereby the software has an opaque ``data neutral'' interface 
and the user is free to choose the storage format or data distribution
of his choice, and the software converts his format to the format used
within the software.  Concern was raised at the performance cost of
this opaque interface at the low-level BLAS routines, as it would
require the re-organization/redistribution of data that could be more
costly than the operation itself.  The forum attendees were divided on
the issue of ``Do the majority of users want the option of a more opaque
data-neutral interface or do they prefer to stay with more traditional
storage formats?''</P>
<P>
The BLAST Lite/Thin and Environmental Routines discussion was next
addressed.  It was decided that the BLAS Lite/Thin would be included
in the ``Journal of Development'' appendix of the document until
this standardization effort has achieved more maturity.  Further
study is needed on the issue of environmental routines.</P>
<P>
The Interval BLAS session summarized the needs of the Interval BLAS 
community addressed in its proposal.  Several attendees asked for 
applications that justify these needed operations.  It was suggested
that the Interval BLAS requires further development and maturation
before it can be considered for inclusion in the document.  At present
the Interval BLAS discussion will be contained in the ``Journal of
Development''.</P>
<P>
The Parallel BLAS discussion re-addressed the issues of developing a
standard for distributed-memory dense BLAS operations.  It was
suggested that to avoid confusion with threaded and shared-memory BLAS
efforts, the effort should not be called Parallel BLAS, but instead
distributed-memory BLAS.  It was proposed that this effort should
define a specific set of functionality needed for distributed-memory
operations, and perhaps add functions for distribution parameter
queries, divide-and-conquer task queue management, and data generation
for input/output.  There should be no alignment restrictions in the
proposed routines, and a Cartesian or block-cyclic mapping plus
replication should be supported for data distribution.  (The document
may say Cartesian, but a particular implementation may be restricted
to a subset of general Cartesian.)  The language binding issue of user
interface was again discussed as some attendees felt that a specific
data distribution should not be specified.  It was further summarized
that operations derived from the Functionality document are
intra-context only, but general tools are provided to allow for
expressing inter-context operations.  This set of intra-context
operations for general redistribution needs to be specified.
Coherency and repeatability requirements need to also be addressed, as
well as the issue of interoperability.  In short, the interface to the
distributed-memory BLAS should resemble the serial interface as
closely as possible.  As a result of the discussion, several attendees
pointed out that we need to address the issue of thread-safety
(repeatability) in the serial dense BLAS.</P>

<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the morning session with a brief overview of 
the agenda for the day.  A tentative date for the next meeting was
first discussed, following by the first reading of the C interface
to the BLAS section of the Legacy BLAS proposal/chapter, and finally
the discussion of the organization/unification of the BLAS document.</P>
<P>
The C Interface to the BLAS proposal was presented as a first reading.
A formal vote was taken on each section of the document.  Nine eligible
voters were in attendance -- Univ. of Tenn., NAG, NIST, Cray, HP/Convex,
Intel, NEC, Univ. of Houston, and Univ. of Notre Dame.  A unanimous vote
of all nine in favor of each section was produced, with only minor
modifications suggested for various sections.  It was proposed that
Section 5.2 would become an appendix, a section would be produced on
error-handling, and the prototypes from the header file would be included
as an appendix.</P>
<P>
Finally, the question of the presentation of the proposal document was
again addressed.  Concern was again raised for the user who is only
interested in one aspect of the standard and must read the entire
document.  A straw vote was taken to ascertain if we should try to
integrate the BLAST proposal into one unified document.  Seventeen
people were present for the vote.  Six attendees voted in favor of the
unified document instead of separate ``proposals'' or stand-alone
chapters.  This document (hereafter referred to as FORM A) primarily
contains separate chapters on functionality, language independent
specifications, and language binding issues.  Interleaved in these
sections would be information pertaining to the sequential, sparse,
parallel, etc.  Eight attendees voted in favor of the BLAS document
with separate self-contained chapters (hereafter referred to as FORM
B) for each of the various flavors of BLAS.  Concern was raised for
the difficulty of maintaining consistency throughout the document if
chapters remain separate.  Three attendees abstained from the straw
vote.</P>
<P>
Discussion continued and a formal vote was taken on the organization/format
of the BLAS document.  Ten eligible voters were present -- representing
the Univ. of Tenn., NAG, NIST, Cray, HP/Convex, Intel, NEC, Univ. of
Houston, Univ. of Notre Dame, and Mississippi State Univ..  Four
attendees voted in favor of FORM A, and six attendees voted in favor
of FORM B.</P>
<P>
It was decided that a draft format for FORM B would be circulated
in a timely manner.</P>
<P>
A summary of the meeting was then provided by Jack Dongarra; he
reviewed the tentative schedule for the next meeting, and thanked
Shane Story and Intel Corporation for hosting the meeting.</P>
<P>
Several of the BLAS chapters (Legacy BLAS, Functionality, and Sparse
BLAS) may be ready for a first reading at the next meeting, and it was
decided that several of the proposed BLAS additions are not developed
enough to consider inclusion in the document as separate chapters,
instead they will be included in the Appendix entitled ``Journal of
Development'' until they are deemed mature enough to be included in
the standardization effort.  An issue that must be decided at the next
meeting will be the language binding issue of an opaque ``data
neutral'' user interface versus a specific pre-defined ``concrete''
interface for the specification of data formats in the Sparse BLAS and
the specification of data distribution in the Parallel BLAS.</P>
<P> 
The ``Journal of Development'' for the BLAS Technical Forum
contains proposals considered for the BLAS Forum
but not included for any of several reasons, including: </P>
<UL> 
<LI>lack of time to complete within the time frame of BLAST Forum, or
<LI>lack of consensus on the syntax, semantics, or pragmatics 
    of the proposed feature. 
</UL>
<P> 
In most cases it was felt that the features in this ``Journal of
Development'' represented capabilities that should be considered.
The BLAS Techinical Forum decided that these proposals should 
be preserved as input to a potential future BLAST Forum process.</P>
<P>
The tentative date of the next forum meeting is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Dec. 3-5, 1997 in Knoxville, TN
</UL>
<P>
and will be hosted by the University of Tennessee, with a preliminary
deadline of November 19, 1997 for subgroup progress.</P>
<P>
The meeting was then adjourned by Jack Dongarra at 12:30 PM.</P>
