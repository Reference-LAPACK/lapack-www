<LI> Seventeen people attended the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/blast-forum.html">BLAST Forum</a> in Berkeley, CA, on December
14-16, 1998.  The meeting was hosted by the University of California
at Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.

<P>
The meeting began at 9:30am.  List of 10 eligible voters: NAG, UT, UC Berkeley,
Bell Labs, HP/Convex, Tera, NIST, Univ of Notre Dame, Sandia, Univ of Houston.
</P>
<P>
A tentative agenda for the meeting shall be:</P>
<UL>
<LI>   Chapter 1:  we need to vote on multiple instances table.
<LI>   Chapter 2:  first reading on bindings. Issues to discuss:
   <UL>
      <LI>         -- naming conventions
      <LI>         -- vote on F95 binding
      <LI>         -- should we have band and packed MM routines?
   </UL>

</UL>
<P>
It was also stressed that we need volunteers for reference implementations
and test codes.  Subgroups met to discuss individual chapters.</P>
<P>
At 11am, the naming convention issue was addressed.  We need to decide on
cblas_ prefix.  Different name for the new stuff, or change the name in the
appendix?  A straw vote was taken.</P>

       </UL>
</UL>
<P>
Chapter 2 was then addressed.  Should we have band and
packed MM routines?  But for performance, we need different storage.
A straw vote was taken on having this functionality-- 13/0/1.
Specific "wording" revisions were suggested for each section, and those
revisions have been incorporated into the chapter.  Formal votes were taken on:

                    row-wise storage looks like.
<LI> Section 2.7 -- All language bindings will have the same textual 
                  description as in the tables.  Collapse DOT, DOTU,
                  and DOTC into one routine using CONJ parameter.
<LI> Section 2.10 -- Similarly, GER, GERU, and GERC are combined.
</UL>
<P>
At 3:30pm, we began discussion of the Extended Precision chapter.
Jim gave an overview of the chapter, and then Dave Bailey discussed
the implementation of extended precision BLAS.</P>
<P>
At 4:30pm, Sven addressed the F95 choice of interface decision.
Optional arguments or key arguments.  Decision delayed until the next
day.</P>
<P>
The meeting adjourned at 5pm.</P>
<HR>
<H2><B>December 15, 1998</B></H2>
<P>
The meeting began at 9am.  Discussion continued on Chapter 2.
We need to document the abs value of complex numbers.  We debated
the readdition of matrix copy.  Combine functionality of slasr and
slartv.</P>
<P>
At 1:15pm, we began discussion on the Sparse BLAS chapter.</P>
<P>
We took a vote to remove the unnecessary "const" from in front of 
certain parameters.  Vote was 8/0/2.  This affects Chapters 2 and 3, and the 
Legacy BLAS chapter.</P>
<P>
We took a straw vote on the framework of Sparse BLAS chapter.
Vote was 10/0/2.</P>
<P>
We then readdressed the key-args versus optional args issue.  A straw
vote was taken was take on those in favor of key arguments interface
-- 6/2/6.  A formal vote was taken on those in favor of OPTIONAL
arguments with derived types for operator arguments -- 8/1/1.</P>
<P>
At 4pm, we had a conference call with Ken Stanley to discuss the 
inclusion of GEMVT and TRMVT interfaces in Chapter 2 (section 2.2.5).  It was
decided that TRMVT was mature enough and should be included, whereas the
interface for GEMVT was still under discussion.  </P>
<P>
The meeting adjourned at 5pm.</P>
<HR>
<H2><B>December 16, 1998</B></H2>
<P>
The meeting began at 8:30am with the discussion of the Interval BLAS
chapter.  Chenyi began by reviewing the changes that were made since
the last meeting.  It was decided that the motivational section should
be moved to the end of the chapter as an appendix, and should be
expanded to include more information on why it is important and 
include an example.  Restructuring of sections to resemble other
chapters. </P>
<P>
Jim Demmel then led the discussion on the voting of the chapter.
Discussion began on the discussion of machine constants in the
chapter.  The definition of overflow is not defined, and delegated to
another committee.  Some of the issues seemed more compiler-related
rather than BLAST committee related.</P>
<P>
The definition of an empty interval (Section 5.2.3, Special Intervals) needs
a more concrete specification.  Section 5.2.3, the implementation of an empty
interval is language dependent.  Formal vote on allowing the definition of an
empty interval to be language dependent, 9/0/0.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Section 5.2.2, 9/0/0.
<LI> Section 5.2.1, 9/0/0.
</UL>
<P>
Naming conventions, suffix _i to be added at the end of the name, e.g.,
f_sgemm_i.  Formal vote, 8/0/0.
Remove discussion of extended precision routines in this chapter.  Major
revisions necessary in Section 5.4 and 5.5.</P>
<P>
The forum then began general discussion.  It was agreed to have another
on-line meeting at the end of January.  The final meeting will be
on March 16--18, 1999 in Knoxville, Tennessee.</P>
<P>
Jim Demmel then discussed test software for the extended precision
chapter and the need for an environmental inquiry function.  However,
the parameters needed in this environmental inquiry routine for the
extended precision routines are more complex than for the routines
in the other chapters.  So it was decided to have two separate
inquiry routines instead of making one general routine.  This would avoid the 
unnecessary complication for the other chapters.  </P>
<UL>
<LI> FPINFO( cmach, prec )
<LI> FPINFO_X( cmach, prec, routine )
</UL>
<P>
It was also stated that Strassen's algorithm is allowed in Chapter 2
(Dense and Banded BLAS) but not in Chapter 4 (Extended and Mixed
Precision BLAS).</P>
<P>
Jim Demmel and Susan Blackford then discussed specific revisions to
Chapter 2 over lunch.  One specific revision suggested was to divide
Table 2.1 (Reduction Operations) into two tables, one for reduction operations
and one for rotation operations.  And for the "dot product" routines (DOT,
DOTU, DOTC), only one routine is needed.  An additional CONJ parameter will
be added to accomodate the complex conjugate version of the routine.  The
same logic will be applied to GER, GERU, GERC.</P>
<P>
The meeting adjourned at 12:30pm.</P>
