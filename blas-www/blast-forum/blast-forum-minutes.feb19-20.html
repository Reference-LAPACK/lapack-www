<UL>
<LI>Twenty-four people attended the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/blast-forum.html">BLAST Forum</a>
in Nashville, TN on February 19-20, 1996.
<LI> Susan Ostrouchov and Andrew Lumsdaine agreed to take minutes for the
meetings.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><B>February 19, 1996</B></H2>
<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the meeting by welcoming everyone and inviting
everyone to introduce themselves.  He then gave a brief summary of the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/sblas-meeting.html"> BLAS
Technical Workshop</a> held in November, 1995 in Knoxville, TN, and
the Birds-Of-A-Feather session held at SuperComputing '95 in San
Diego, CA.</P>
<P>
The discussion began with the question ``What do we want to
accomplish?''.  Basic functionality was stressed along with who will
benefit from our efforts.  Our efforts should leverage from existing
technology and provide backward compatibility.  No particular
programming language will be primary, instead we will discuss syntax
and semantics that apply to Fortran 77, Fortran 90, C, and C++.  We
discussed portability and efficiency and at what levels of the
interface each is most important.  It was proposed that we need to
provide testing software and specifications for BLAS routines in
general.  It would be good to supply reference implementations
of what is agreed on as we identify and define the interface.
Matrix creation routines were proposed for the parallel
BLAS, and ``multiple instances'' routines were proposed for the dense
serial BLAS.  The inclusion of interval BLAS was also proposed.</P>
<P>
Jack Dongarra then displayed a slide from Mike Heroux about an update
to the
<a href="http://www.cray.com/PUBLIC/APPS/SERVICES/ALGORITHMS/spblastk.ps">
Sparse BLAS Toolkit.</a>
<P>
The idea of ``layering'' of the BLAS packages
in a hierarchical view of development was presented.
We propose to build an object-based interface on the top of the Lite
BLAS.  A straw vote was taken on the issue of whether the user
interface should be object-based or lite-based.  Thirteen people
voted to discuss both issues together, zero people voted to discuss
solely object-based, and ten people voted to discuss solely
lite-based BLAS. </P>
<P>
BLAS Lite would provide a highly efficient set of computational kernels for
basic linear algebra operations.  The interface would be light weight 
in the sense that they would have little overhead and provide for
good performance on all problem sizes, in particular small size problems.</P>
<P>
The interface would have</P>
<UL>
<LI>  No run-time function overloading with additional arguments.
      (Such an interface could be provided on top of this layer.)
<LI>  No error-checking should be performed.
<LI>  No character string arguments should be allowed.
<LI>  Code should be inlineable.
<LI>  Software should allow caching of reusable structure information.
<LI>  Separate interface for stride 1 operations is needed.
</UL>
<P>
Jack Dongarra proposed that the rules for the meeting be adopted 
that are similar to those that were established for the MPI and 
HPF Forum meetings.  For a preliminary set of forum rules for discussion see:
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/blast-forum-rules.html">
rules</a></P>
<P>
Issues of advertising and mailing lists were also discussed.
It was decided that an aggressive strategy should be used to encourage 
more application programmers and hardware and software vendors to attend.</P>
<P>
It was decided to restrict discussion to 3 primary meta-subgroups:</P>
<UL>
<LI> abstract functionality
<LI> BLAS Lite
<LI> object-based BLAS
</UL>
<P>
Barry Smith presented a discussion on abstract functionality for all
versions of the BLAS.  His basic question was ``What should the BLAS
be?''.  He chose to ignore the issues specific to dense, sparse, or
parallel BLAS, and instead discuss the general functionality issues
pertaining to the different types.  A second question was: ``Is
functionality directly related to parallelism?''.  Again the issue of
``multiple instances'' was discussed.  There are different ways of
classifying functionality -- BLAS-like and tensor notation.  Should we
extend our classification of the BLAS to a different notation?</P>
<P>
It was concluded that we need input from the user community on the
most needed functionality.  We will create a web page to present our
proposed functionality and ask for comments and suggestions.</P>
<P>
After a break, Andrew Lumsdaine presented a proposal for an object-based
interface for the BLAS.  He began by asking</P>
<UL>
<LI> What are the objects?
<LI> What attributes should they have?
<LI> What functionality should they have?
</UL>
<P>
Some of the key questions that were addressed were:</P>
<OL>
<LI> Is a vector a matrix or something else?
<LI> Are sparsity, symmetry, triangular attributes or should they be different
types?
</OL>
<P>
On question #1, Robert van de Geijn strongly suggested that vectors
and matrices should be considered separately.  He proposed that we
consider vectors, multi-vectors, matrices and multi-matrices.  This
view was seconded was several people in the audience including those
proposing the inclusion of ``multiple instances'' routines in the
BLAS.</P>
<P>
On question #2, Barry Smith suggested that we consider them as both,
and proposed that we prepare a list of attributes.</P>
<P>
During the discussion of the object-based interface, Andrew Lumsdaine
mentioned that it may be important to consider the effects of new
parts of the ANSI C++ standard, especially the Standard Template
Library.</P>
<P>
It was also proposed that we create and provide class libraries.  We
should propose class definitions for each language, and these will
live on top of the same kernels.  We would be restricted by the shared
features of all four languages.  The ``lite'' kernels are language
independent, and only at the higher level do the interfaces need to
interact with the specifics of the language.</P>
<P>
It was then asked what storage formats should be supported.  Should
the formats be explicit (since different formats offer different
performance at different stages), and should the functions be
``objectified'', i.e., persistent functions?  It was decided that we
should allow matrix free formats, and allow arbitrary block sizes.</P>
<P>
And finally, Anne Trefethen presented her remarks on library development
as it was done in the CMSSL library at Thinking Machines.  She presented
object-based examples, shifts, poly-shifts (shifts from multiple
dimensions), matrix extraction, and partitioned gather/scatter.</P>
<P>
After dinner, Robert van de Geijn presented a brief session to discuss
his ideas on matrix distribution in the parallel setting.</P>
<HR>
<H2><B>February 20, 1996</B></H2>
<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the morning session with a summary of the
previous day's discussions.  The first topic of the morning was a
continuation of the discussion of the object-based BLAS interface,
which was again led by Andrew Lumsdaine.  During this session, the
discussion was focused on categorizing important issues to be
addressed regarding objet-based BLAS.  Besides those from the previous
object-based BLAS session, the following issues were raised:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Who are the users of the object-based BLAS?
<LI> Sub-matrices should be able to be extracted easily.
<LI> A means for expressing blocking must be provided.  Blocking
     issues can be due to application, algorithm, and architecture,
     and all three types of blocking need to be considered, as well as
     other types of spatial and temporal locality that might impact
     performance.
<LI> A generalization of the blocking specification would be the
     provision of a general "hints" interface.  Kaufman stressed the
     importance of providing good defaults for such an interface. 
<LI> A clean and efficient interface for building and accessing
     objects must be provided.  One particular case that was discussed
     by van de Geijn was that of elemental construction.
<LI> Hierarchical definitions of vectors and matrices should be
     supported.
<LI> Proper indexing abstractions, both for sequential and distributed
     objects, are important.  This issue is related to blocking
     and submatrix extraction.
<LI> What language interfaces should be provided, and what syntax and
     semantics should be associated?
<LI> What properties will the matrix and vector objects have?  Will
     they be mutable?
<LI> The issue of multiple instances was again discussed and must
     clearly be supported.  One issue to be resolved is how regular or
     irregular multiple instance problems may be.
</UL>
<P>
Next, Robert van de Geijn presented an overview of hp-adaptive methods in
order to illustrate some of the issues that arise in real
applications.  (The need for involvement from the applications
community was a recurring theme throughout the meeting.)  One new
issue that was brought up by Robert's example was the need for
providing matrices that can be dynamically sized.  </P>
<P>
After a short break, the meeting resumed and Barry Smith began with an
overview of his impressions of the previous day's discussions.  He
presented a chart to illustrate the interactions between the so-called
lite level, the object-based level, the language bindings, and the
BLAS compatibility layer.  Interacting with all of these was the
specification of functionality.</P>
<P>
Barry then presented an example of lite-level and object-level
code to illustrate what he perceived to be the important differences.
He stressed the importance of clearly distinguishing between the two
levels in terms of their requirements.  Anne Trefethen raised the important
point that even though the forum is initially considering the design
of sequential functions that it is extremely important to consider the
impact of our design decisions on future use of the functions by
parallel libraries (in particular the parallel BLAS).</P>
<P>
Some discussion of language interfaces followed and there was some
debate about what the F77 and C interfaces should look like.  van de
Geijn presented an example of a F77 parallel Cholesky factorization
using an object-flavored library.  Some of the Fortran programmers in
the audience were not comfortable with the programming practices used
in the example and were not certain whether an object-based interface
would find wide acceptance in the F77 community.  Barry Smith then suggested
that perhaps an object-based interface for F77 should not be
supported.  Lumsdaine mentioned that in the MPI Forum, such issues are
handled by letting interested parties work on the areas that are of
concern to them, i.e., if someone wants F77 support, they should
propose the interface and participate in the BLAST forum.</P>
<P>
Following lunch, Linda Kaufman led a discussion of BLAS functionality.
The primary issues discussed were</P>
<UL>
<LI> Generalizing certain vector operations (e.g., AXPY) to the
     matrix case.  There was general agreement that this was sensible
     in the dense case. 
<LI> Householder transformations should be supported.
<LI> The necessity of supporting multiple instances.  Again, the issue
     of how regular a collection of problems would have to be to be
     considered a multiple instance was discussed.  Tensors were
     mentioned as possibly being an appropriate mathematical tool for
     discussing multiple instance problems.
<LI> Operations of the form A*B*C might be considered for support.
</UL>
<P>
Thread safety was also raised as a concern.</P>
<P>
Sven Hammarling next discussed a proposal from Demmel and Kahan for
extended precision BLAS.  This was felt to be a difficult issue
because of the need for hardware support in order to obtain high
performance.  On the other hand, the proposal was felt to be a
reasonable one.</P>
<P>
Support for interval arithmetic was also discussed.  Jack Dongarra
asked Chenyi Hu briely introduced interval computing. Hu suggested to
establish an interval BLAS subgroup.</P>
<P>
Dongarra wrapped up the meeting by establishing the following
subgroups and their leaders:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Functionality -- Sven Hammarling and Barry Smith
<LI> Lite -- Tony Skjellum and Barry Smith
<LI> Object-based -- Andrew Lumsdaine and Anne Trefethen
</UL>
<P>
Mailing lists would be setup for these subgroups as well as a general 
mailing list and a mailing list for people who have attended the Forum.</P>
<UL>
<LI>  blast-comm@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-core@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-function@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-lite@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-ob@cs.utk.edu

<LI>  blast-parallel@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-ds@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-sparse@cs.utk.edu
<LI>  blast-ext@cs.utk.edu
</UL>
<P>
A Web page will be set up and advertised and will be used to gather
comments on the forum discussions.  In particular, we are interested
in finding out what functionality the user community feels to be
important.</P>
<P>
The dates of the next forum meetings are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> April 12 @ Copper Mountain (not a working meeting)
<LI> May 20-22 (exact place and date to be decided within 2 weeks)

</UL>

<P>
Jack Dongarra mentioned that he would investigate possibilities for travel
funds (similar to MPI). These travel funds are intended to partially reimburse
travel for US academic participation.</P>
<P>
The meeting was then adjourned by Jack Dongarra at 3:00 PM.</P>
