<LI>Thirty-two people attended the <a href="http://www.netlib.org/utk/papers/blast-forum.html">BLAST Forum</a> in Dallas, TX on
February 27-28, 1997.  The meeting was hosted by HP/Convex.
</UL>
<HR>
<H2><B>February 27, 1997</B></H2>
<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the meeting by welcoming everyone and inviting
everyone to introduce themselves.  He then reviewed the technical
``rules of order'' for the first and second readings of proposals, as
well as the voting procedures for the meeting.  Tony Skjellum
suggested that we integrate all of the proposals into one unified
document, similar in style to the MPI proposal.  This issue was
discussed in further detail later in the meeting.</P>
<P>
The following presentations were made:</P>
<UL>
<LI>BLAS Functionality -- Sven Hammarling and Linda Kaufman
<LI>Sparse BLAS -- Roldan Pozo
<LI>BLAS Lite -- Tony Skjellum
<LI>Parallel BLAS -- Antoine Petitet
<LI>Interval BLAS -- Chenyi Hu
<LI>C Interface to the BLAS -- Clint Whaley
<LI>Language binding issues -- Andrew Lumsdaine
</UL>
<P>
BLAS functionality was the first to be addressed.  Sven Hammarling of
NAG gave a brief overview of the Functionality proposal that has been
available via the BLAST Forum homepage, as well as addressing several
email messages from users pertaining to desired ``new'' routines.  He
stressed the areas of the proposal that still need to be written,
specifically the introductory background motivation, performance
issues, numerical stability, as well as justification for the new
proposed functionality.  Any new functionality that is proposed should
have a clear justification identifying the applications where this
operation is needed.  Several attendees debated if some of the
information contained in the proposal is not strictly
``functionality'' issues, but rather language independent
specifications as well as language bindings.  It was proposed that
some of the information in the tables of proposed routines be
reorganized into separate sections on these issues.</P>
<P>
Linda Kaufman of Bell Labs then spoke about her recent revisions to
the proposal, namely adding priorities to each of the new proposed
routines.  Mimi Celis of SGI and Sven Hammarling of NAG directed
attention to the standardization efforts of the VSIP (Vector, Signal
and Image Processing) community.  Roldan Pozo of NIST proposed a study
to see the use of BLAS in applications.  He stressed an effort to
clearly justify what is included and what is not included in order to
realistically accomplish our goals.  Several of the application
developers present in the meeting voiced that they felt the
``Functionality'' proposal does accurately reflect the needs of their
users.  However, it was also pointed out that there are those in the
numerical analysis community who will never rewrite their codes in
terms of the BLAS.  And in some cases, it is too expensive to rewrite
optimized existing application programs such as NASTRAN and GAUSSIAN
in terms of the BLAS.  Some vendors have inserted BLAS calls inside
these codes, while others have chosen to optimize them in different
ways.</P>
<P>
Tony Skjellum of Mississippi State emphasized that most programmers
develop their algorithms first in ``matlab-type'' environments.  The
use of standards in numerical analysis programming could be increased
by promoting a ``BLAST toolbox'' in Matlab, or more strongly encourage
the use of LAPACK and the BLAS inside of Matlab.</P>
<P>
After a break, Roldan Pozo of NIST presented the sparse BLAS proposal
that is available on the BLAST Forum homepage.  He discussed the roles
and functionality of the Sparse BLAS, as well as open issues in their
development.  Again it was voiced that several of the issues discussed
were not primarily functionality issues but language binding issues.
Concern was also expressed by several attendees due to the sheer
volume of routines proposed.  In order for a sparse BLAS to be more
readily accepted, the number of proposed routines may need to be
reduced.</P>
<P>
After Roldan's presentation, a break-out session for the meeting of
subgroups was held.  The following subgroups met: functionality,
sparse BLAS, parallel BLAS, lite BLAS, and the C interface to the
BLAS.</P>
<HR>
<H2><B>February 28, 1997</B></H2>
<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the morning session with a brief summary of the
previous day's discussions.</P>
<P>
Tony Skjellum began the morning discussions with an overview of his
thoughts on the presentation of our ``proposals'' for the BLAST work,
specifically organization of a unified document for the BLAST
proposal instead of separate ``proposals''.  The document would primarily
contain separate chapters on functionality, language independent
specifications, and language binding issues.  Interleaved in these
sections would be information pertaining to the sequential, sparse,
parallel, etc.  Several attendees voiced concern at this one proposal idea
instead of separate proposals.  Specifically, if a user or vendor
is only interested in information pertaining to the sparse BLAS, he
would still need to read the entire document.  Richard Hanson of VNI
suggested that we have an ``implementation'' chapter or appendix
to ease the integration job for the vendors.  Linda Kaufman of Bell
Labs further suggested a ``tutorial'' or ``quick reference guide''
for each of the different standards proposed.  Jack Dongarra of UT
stressed the importance of a reference implementation that should
be included with the standard.</P>
<P>
Following this discussion, Tony Skjellum presented the BLAS Lite
proposal that is available on the BLAST Forum homepage.  Several
vendors expressed concern about the volume of routines that are
proposed.  It was suggested that a more extensive performance
evaluation of the Lite BLAS be conducted before a decision is made on
their inclusion in the standardization effort.  Concern was raised
about the portability of the Lite BLAS since they are in effect a
``cache-based'' BLAS.  Andrew Lumsdaine and Brian McCandless, who have
implemented preliminary versions of the BLAS Lite routines, promised
to make their results available to the BLAST Forum in a timely
fashion.</P>
<P>
Antoine Petitet of UT led discussion on the issues involved in
developing a set of parallel BLAS.  A note discussing the issues
is available on the BLAST Forum homepage.</P>
<P>
Chenyi Hu of the University of Houston, Downtown, presented a few
slides on the needs of the Interval BLAS community.  It was suggested
that a separate section for the Interval BLAS be included in the
BLAST proposal.</P>
<P>
After lunch, Clint Whaley of UT summarized what is contained in the
``C Interface to the Existing BLAS'' proposal available on the BLAS
Forum homepage.  He also discussed what occurred in the ``break-out''
session the previous day.  Jesse Bennett of Texas Instruments also
gave a brief presentation on what he perceives as user needs for the
CBLAS.  The majority of opinions from vendors supported the view that
the operations should be ``row-major'', and that character arguments
should be handled as enumerated types.  Mimi Celis of SGI specifically
said that SGI had introduced a C interface for the BLAS which was
``column-major'' and the C users refused to use it.  It was then
suggested that it may be possible to present a ``row-major'' interface
to the existing BLAS through careful manipulation of the transpose in
calculations.  An attendee thought that this is the way that Digital
Corporation presented a ``row-major'' interface, and this is under
investigation.  Again the VSIP standardization effort was mentioned in
regards to two-dimensional arrays in Fortran versus C.  Mimi Celis of
SGI stated that in the VSIP effort it is assumed that two-dimensional
arrays in C are contiguous.  Email conversation on these topics (as
well as the issue of a ``complex'' data type) were encouraged.</P>
<P>
Andrew Lumsdaine next spoke about the question of the organization of
the Forum, the presentation of the proposal document, the varied user
base, and his recommendations for how we should proceed.  Concern was
again raised for the user who is only interested in one aspect of the
standard and must read the entire document.  A straw vote was taken to
ascertain if we should try to integrate the BLAST proposal into one
unified document.  Appendices for a ``tutorial'' and ``reference
implementation'' will be included.  The vote was unanimous to
integrate the proposals into one unified document.  Twenty-two people
were present for the vote.</P>
<P>
A summary of the meeting was then provided by Jack Dongarra.  He focused
on the specific tasks of writing several needed chapters for the
BLAST proposal.  Namely:</P>
<UL>
<LI>New BLAS -- Sven/Linda/Roldan/Karin/Antoine
<LI>LiteBLAS -- Tony/Andrew/Puri/...
<LI>LegacyBLAS -- Clint/...
</UL>
<P>
The document will be established on the net, and individual chapters
will be available for downloading in latex format.</P>
<P>
The global editors for the BLAST proposal are Andrew Lumsdaine and
Tony Skjellum.</P>
<P>
The tentative date of the next forum meeting is:</P>
<UL>
<LI>May 11-12, 1997 in Portland, OR
</UL>
<P>
and will be hosted by Intel Corporation, with a preliminary deadline
of April 30, 1997 for subgroup progress.</P>
<P>
The meeting was then adjourned by Jack Dongarra at 3:00 PM.</P>
