Forum</a>
in Atlanta, GA on May 20-21, 1996.

Jack Dongarra opened the meeting by welcoming everyone and inviting
everyone to introduce themselves.  He then gave a brief summary of the
previous BLAS workshops, and asked which subgroups should meet at this
workshop.  It was decided that the following subgroups would be
discussed:</P>
<UL>
<LI>BLAS Functionality
<LI>BLAS Lite
<LI>BLAS Object-Based 
</UL>
<P>
BLAS functionality was the first to be addressed.  The discussion
focused on the draft of the Functionality proposal that Barry Smith of
ANL and Sven Hammarling of NAG had written and made available via the
BLAS Forum homepage.  Sven gave a brief overview of the proposal and
invited comments and suggestions.  Several attendees voiced their
opinions on the proposal, and each of the lists of proposed routines
were discussed, as well as possible additions.  Revised lists were to
be prepared that night and presented the following day.  Anne
Trefethen volunteered to expand the ``multiple instances'' section for
the proposal.</P>
<P>
No particular programming language will be primary in the discussion
of functionality, instead we will discuss syntax and semantics for
Fortran 77, Fortran 90, C, and C++.  We shall provide reference
implementations for the proposed BLAS routines in each language.</P>
<P>
There are different ways of classifying functionality -- BLAS-like and
tensor notation.  Andrew Lumsdaine led a discussion explaining the
proposed tensor notation.  An open question for the forum is whether
one or both of the classification schemes should be used.</P>
<P>
After a break, the BLAS Lite were discussed.  Two versions of the BLAS
Lite were proposed.  One (debugging) version with error-checking, and
another (performance) version without error-checking.  To provide good
performance on all problem sizes, separate interfaces for stride 1
operations may be provided, as well as separate routines for small
(block) problems, e.g., matrix multiplies of size 2, 3, 4, and 5.</P>
<P>
Puri Bangalore raised the issue of specifying time and space (CPU and
memory) complexity for various routines.  This sort of specification
is clearly useful for users of the routines, especially when the user
might want to choose between various routines that provide similar
functionality but which have different CPU/memory usage.  However, it
is not clear that many of the proposed BLAS functions admit
implementations that have differing CPU/memory complexity.  The
obvious exceptions are xNRM2 (Euclidean vector norm) and matrix
multiply.  An open question here is whether we should give options for
varying degrees of accuracy depending upon time and space
considerations.  Specifically, should a fast version of
xNRM2 or a Strassen matrix multiply be provided?</P>

<P>
Jack Dongarra opened the morning session with a summary of the
previous day's discussions.  The first topic of the morning was the
discussion of the object-based BLAS interface, led by Andrew Lumsdaine.</P>
<P>
During the discussion of the object-based interface, Andrew Lumsdaine
mentioned that it may be important to consider the effects of new
parts of the ANSI C++ standard, especially the Standard Template
Library.  He stressed the composition (templates) approach to building
the library instead of the inheritance approach.</P>
<P>
After a short break, Sven Hammarling spoke on the proposed revisions
to the Functionality proposal.  Specifically, updated tables of 
routines were presented.</P>
<P>
Anne Trefethen gave input on the needed ``multiple instance'' routines.</P>
<P>
The Lite BLAS were again discussed.  Puri Bangalore opened the
discussion by asking which data types, matrix types, and storage
formats should be supported.  Puri provided a list as a starting point
and several attendees suggested additions.</P>
<P>
The issue of error checking was introduced.  Puri suggested that all
functions should return an error code.  Barry Smith pointed out that
in the BLAS Lite there are very few errors that can occur.  It was
then suggested that each BLAS function might have two entry points, in
similar fashion to MPI.</P>
<P>
Puri then raised the thorny issue of indexing, in particular, whether
indexing should be 0 based (as in C) or 1 based (as in Fortran).  For
dense linear algebra this is not a real problem, but it is a problem
when user data maintains explicit indexing information (as in
compressed sparse storage schemes).  Suggested options for indexing
were to support both via run-time or compile-time schemes or to make
the index support language-dependent.</P>
<P>
Next, Puri asked whether a stride argument is needed.  Sven indicated
that stride arguments are convenient and are required by some
algorithms.</P>
<P>
Puri also addressed guidelines to implementors and discussed these
four issues:</P>
<OL>
<LI>specification for time and space complexities for the different functions
<LI>options for fast/sloppy and accurate implementions, if possible
<LI>provision of a poly-algorithmic interface through the object-based or
object-oriented BLAS layer
<LI>use of temporary storage or buffer inside a BLAS function call.
</OL>
<P>
The vendors expressed concern about the amount of work that these
guidelines might impose upon them. It was clarified that this was intended
to be mostly documentation, rather than additional implementation work.
Puri suggested that the implementors were free to do what is best for
their architecture, but as a library writer or user one would like to
know what has been done, at least in terms of memory usage if extra memory
is allocated within a function.</P>
<P>
After a lunch break, Barry Smith spoke of sample implementations of
the BLAS Lite.  Proposed calling sequences for routines were
discussed, as well as the necessity for reference implementations of
some of the routines.  Barry volunteered for ANL to implement the C
and C++ versions of the routines.  The University
of Tennessee will provide Fortran 90 reference implementations for some
of the routines.</P>
<P> 
Jack Dongarra wrapped up the meeting by suggesting that the
Functionality proposal be finished by summer.  Andrew Lumsdaine will
also draft an Object-based BLAS proposal.  Both proposals will be
available on the Web page, and comments/suggestions from the user
community are welcome.</P>
<P>
The dates of the next forum meetings are:</P>
<UL>
<LI> Aug. 12-14 possible date depending on what's accomplished over the summer
<LI> Oct. 9-11  SIAM Sparse Matrix Meeting @ Coeur d'Alene (not a working
meeting)
<LI> Nov. 18-22 SuperComputing '96
</UL>
<P>
The meeting was then adjourned by Jack Dongarra at 3:30 PM.</P>
