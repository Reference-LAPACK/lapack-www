<p>

We are planning a BLAS Technical Forum meeting on November 7-8.
The meeting will be hosted Michael Heroux and the meeting will
be held at Cray Research's facility in Eagan, MN:
 
 
   <dd> Cray Research, Inc. -- A Silicon Graphics Company
   <dd> 655 Lone Oak Drive
   <dd> Eagan, MN 55121


 
<p>
The Forum has been established to consider expanding the Basic Linear
Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) in a number of directions in the light of
modern software, language, and hardware developments. The first meeting
of the Forum was held in Nashville on February 19-20, 1996 and the next
meeting was in Atlanta on May 20-21, 1996.
 
<p>
Working groups have been established to consider the overall
functionality, a lightweight interface, and an object based interface,
for the BLAS. Other subgroups have also been established, either to
advise the current working groups or as placeholders for future working
groups on parallel processing issues, sparse operations, data structures,
extensions to the existing BLAS and language binding issues.
 
<p>
We strongly urge and encourage attendance at the meeting
so that we can make tangible progress towards much needed standards.
Wide input is needed to help ensure that emerging proposals are useful
and acceptable to the community.
 

<p>
It is appreciated that it is not easy for everyone to attend the
meetings of the Forum, but we would nevertheless welcome your input
since we wish the discussion to be as open as possible, and the results
to reflect consensus from the community at large.



for the parallel and sequential settings, as well as standards for
basic matrix data structures, both dense and sparse.
