Preliminary BLAST Forum Rules
</h1>
</center>

<center>
<h3>
We will discuss
adopting a set of rules for the Forum. 
<p>
As a starting point for discussions we have put together a set of
rules derived from the
HPF and MPI Forums.
</h3></center>



<center>
<h2>
General Organization
</h2></center>

<p>
Everything is public and open.
Most of the technical details hammered out in subgroups, which makes
the base proposals.
The main group discuss these proposals and
votes on adopting them.
Technical discussions for the most part done on email lists.
Subgroup bring their own proposal as handouts.
Unified draft put together from these.


<center>
<h2>
Main Group / Plenary Session Matters
</h2></center>

<p>
For running discussions, use loosely-enforced Robert's Rules of
Order.  Basically, we won't stand on formalities unless the discussion
is becoming unruly.  Some of the more often-invoked rules:

<ul>
	<p><li> 1. Moving and voting on amendments before the main proposal. 
           Basically, this will keep the discussions focussed.
	<p><li> 2. Motions coming out of committee (subgroup) are automatically
	   seconded; others need a second from the floor.
	<p><li> 3. Triply-nested amendments are not allowed.  This keeps the confusion
	   down.
</ul>

<p>
Generally, whoever is making the presentation runs the discussion,
recognized comments from the floor, etc. 
Convener comes in after the meat of the discussion to run the votes. 
Comments during discussion handled by going around the room
clockwise.

<p>
Will pass around an attendance sheet at each meeting to
keep track of who was there.
Organizations are asked to commit to having the same
attendee at every meeting.  It's very
important to have this kind of continuity in attendees, else we could
have spent too much time in remedial education.

<p>
<a name="voting_rules">
Each organization (school, company, lab) gets one vote - note this is on an
organization basis, not a person.
Representatives from an organization should
agreed on who is voting.
An organization is eligible to vote if it had
attended 2 of the last 3 meetings, counting the current meeting (i.e. you
could attend every other meeting and still vote; you could not vote at your
first meeting). Obviously, not enforced at the first
two meetings.
</a>

<p>
Accepting a section of the BLAST spec is a multi-step process.
<ul>
	<p><li> 1. Someone writes a draft specification; 
	Details of these are hashed out in the subgroup.
	<p><li> 2. First Reading: The subgroup leader (or occasionally the draft author)
	presented the subgroup-approved draft to the main group.  When there is
	controversy, it is usually pointed out.  The main group discussed,
	suggested changes, and holds a series of "straw votes" on the
	proposal.  All attendees are eligible to vote in straw votes, which
	are not binding on the subgroups.
	<p><li> 3. More subgroup discussion, both electronic and in person at the next
	meeting, producing a revised proposal.
	<p><li> 4. Second Reading: The subgroup leader presented the revised proposal to
	the main group.  Sections that are substantially the same as the
	original (or an alternative presented at the first reading) are amended
	by motion and eventually voted on.  Eligibility for votes was as
	explained above.  Major additions 
	are treated as first readings at this
	point.  A few sections may be
	sent back to subgroup for more work; these can come
        back as second readings at the next meeting.
	<p><li> 5. Once a section is accepted at second reading, it is "frozen" until
	the end of the BLAST process.  Revisions are only allowed for clarity or
	when new information surfaced (like discovering that the draft is
	self-contradictory).  
	<p><li> 6. At the end of the process, we promised to allow
	reconsideration of any feature.
</ul>

<h2>
Subgroup Matters
</h2></center>

<p>
Subgroups meet independently of the main body, usually the afternoon and
evening of the day before.  The leader of the subgroup run these meetings
using whatever style he or she is comfortable with.  
Also, there is a mailing list for each subgroup where most 
of the discussions goes on.

<p>
Each subgroup is devoted to one topic from the following list (prelimary):

<ul>
  <p><li> BLAS functionality subcommittee
  <p><li> BLAS lite subcommittee
  <p><li> sparse BLAS subcommittee
  <p><li> parallel BLAS subcommittee
  <p><li> extensions to existing BLAS subcommittee
  <p><li> data structures subcommittee
  <p><li> language binding subcommittee
</ul>

<p>
The groups meet in parallel, which may cause a little friction but is
logistically unavoidable.  When a subject straddled two groups, the subgroup
leaders would talk to each other and decide who would handle it - this
may lead to minor anti-turf battles (also known as "after you"
deadlock).  Both groups would act as sanity checks on the results.

<p>
When it comes time to write the draft, each subgroup become a chapter. 
The subgroup leader is the editor (and usually major author) of the
chapter, and is responsible for making sure the chapter reflected the
decisions made in the subgroup and in committee.

Logistical Matters

<p>
Meetings are 2.5 days, starting Monday or Wednesday afternoon, in Nasville.
A typical schedule is

<p>
We will try to finish as early as possible on Friday, to allow people to
catch flights.


<p>
We financed the meetings primarily from a per-meeting fee of $75 
per attendee.  
We have no other source of funding at this time.

<p>
For future planning here is a tentative list of dates, roughly 3 months apart,
for the series of meetings:
<ul>
  <p><li> BLAS session on April 12 at the Copper Mountain meeting
  <p><li> BLAST Forum Meeting May 20-22 start noon on 5/20 depart noon 5/22.
  <p><li> BLAST Forum Meeting August 12-14 start noon on 9/12 depart noon 12/14.
  <p><li> November 18-22 (Supercomputer 96 Meeting)
</ul>

<h2>
Documentation
</h2></center>



<p>
The Draft: ?? serves as our
general editor, collecting the chapters and trying to smooth format
details. 
We will try the following framework:
<ul>
	<p><li> 1. The Editor has the "official" version of the draft.  He sets deadlines for
	receiving the chapters, and edits for formatting.
	<p><li> 2. The Editor sends the Chairman the whole document when all the chapters 
        are done. 
	<p><li> 3. The Chairman sends the document to the "core" mail group (see below), 
        puts it out for anonymous FTP, netlib, and announces it on the net.
	<p><li> 4. Any further changes are supposed to be made to the Editor's edited
	copy, not the original version.
</ul>

<p>
Each subgroup writes one chapter, generally written and/or edited by the
subgroup leader. 
Also, the author
of each section is identified in a footnote at the beginning of the
section, along with the date (and occasionally other version information).
The chapter authors should realize they are writing a draft
chapter, not a stand-alone document.

<p>
Mailing lists: Every subgroup has its own mailing list.  Those lists are
where most of the technical action happened.
On top of that,
there is a list for everybody in the world interested in BLAST, and another
for the "core" group. The "everybody" list is used for the meeting minutes
and a few miscellaneous announcements. The core group list is primarily
for the meeting attendees, but a few others are also on it for political
and/or practical reasons;
it got meeting details, and copies of the various
proposals before the meetings. All lists are kept at cs.utk.edu 
People can add or
delete themselves to/from any of the lists by mailing to dongarra@cs.utk.edu.

<p>
The following mailing lists have been set up.

<ul>
  <p><li> blast-comm@cs.utk.edu          Everyone
  <p><li> blast-core@cs.utk.edu          people who attended the last few meetings
  <p><li> blast-lang@cs.utk.edu          Language binding subcommittee
  <p><li> blast-function@cs.utk.edu      Blas functionality
  <p><li> blast-lite@cs.utk.edu          BLAS lite interface
  <p><li> blast-ob@cs.utk.edu            Object based 
  <p><li> blast-parallel@cs.utk.edu      parallel processing
  <p><li> blast-ds@cs.utk.edu            data structures
  <p><li> blast-sparse@cs.utk.edu        sparse operations
  <p><li> blast-ext@cs.utk.edu           extensions to the existing BLAS

</ul>


<p>
Minutes: Susan Ostrouchov and Andrew Lumsdaine have agreed to take minutes
for the general meeting. Each subcommittee should also have minutes taken.

Announcements of major news (new drafts, etc.) to go everywhere we can
think of.  This includes the "world" mailing list; newsgroups
comp.lang.fortran, comp.lang.misc, and comp.parallel; (indirectly)
na-net, scinet, and hpcwire.  Meeting minutes go to the world and core
mailing lists and the newsgroups.  
Good idea to mention BLAST when giving talks.
