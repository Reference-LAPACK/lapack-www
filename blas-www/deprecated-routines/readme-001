Subject:        [Lapack] Re: discrepancy in source code?

Hello

I would like some clarification on a discrepancy I found. A call to
dtrsm in dgelub appears to be missing a parameter. The subroutine dtrsm
requires 11 parameters to call. In subroutine dgelub, when call is made
to dtrsm only 10 parameters are passed. Thanks ahead of time.


  From _http://www.netlib.org/blas/dgelub.f_

*        Compute superdiagonal block of U.
*
          CALL DTRSM ('Left','Lower','No transpose','Unit',
      $               J-1,JB,A(1,1),LDA,A(1,J),LDA)


Though in _http://www.netlib.org/blas/dtrsm.f_

       SUBROUTINE DTRSM ( SIDE, UPLO, TRANSA, DIAG, M, N, ALPHA, A, LDA,
      $                   B, LDB )

Dear David,

That certainly looks like a bug.  I would recommend that you use an LAPACK
routine instead of dgelub; DGETRF is the equivalent LAPACK routine.

Best wishes,

Sven Hammarling.

Dear Dr. Hochmann:

This isn't a bug in LAPACK because dgelub is not an LAPACK routine.  It
appears to be an early prototype for the LAPACK factorization routine
DGETRF.  This routine is certainly buggy and it and dgelu.f should be
deleted from netlib.  As Sven pointed out, you should use the LAPACK
routine instead.

My hard copy of the Argonne technical report describing the Level 3 BLAS
has a hand-written note that says ALPHA was added to the argument list
for xTRMM and xTRSM in June, 1988.  The argument ALPHA is present in the
Argonne report (my copy is dated July 19, 1988) and in the TOMS version
which appeared in 1990, and it should be present in all software
developed since then.
