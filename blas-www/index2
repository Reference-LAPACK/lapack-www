MACHINE CONSTANTS
i1mach  integer machine constants (like Fortran units for standard input)
r1mach  real machine constants (like "machine epsilon" and "biggest number")
d1mach  double precision machine constants

These routines were introduced in the PORT library and published in TOMS;
They represent values checked by extensive testing and are not naive counts
of "how many bits in a word".  Because some machines use extended precision
registers, trying to calculate such quantities directly is problematical. As
far as possible, we replace machine constants in the various netlib libraries
by calls to *1mach and keep these three routines up to date.
