1. comments on machine constants.

i1mach, r1mach, d1mach were introduced in the PORT library;
They represent values checked by extensive testing and are not naive counts
of "how many bits in a word".  Because some machines use extended precision
registers (and others have "dirty" corners in floating point space, trying
to calculate such quantities directly is problematical.  When practical,
we replace machine constants in the various netlib libraries by calls
to *1mach and keep these three routines up to date.


2. comments on double complex

If you get error messages from your compiler, chances are that double
complex intrisic functions are spelled differently on your system.
Since this didn't make it into the Fortran77 standard, vendors adopted
incompatible conventions.
