For efficient computation using linpack or lapack, it is important that
you replace the "reference implementation" Fortran BLAS by a version
tuned to your computer architecture.  Your vendor may already have
supplied such a library, since it is crucial to their competitive
benchmarking.  Here we collect random notes about known versions.

IBM/360 assembler blas1 are available by "send blas.ibm from toms".

SGI     As of IRIX 4.0, link with "f77 -mp -lblas".
