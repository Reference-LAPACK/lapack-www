LAPACK is a software package provided by Univ. of Tennessee; Univ. of California, Berkeley; Univ. of Colorado Denver; and NAG Ltd..

== Presentation

LAPACK is written in Fortran 90 and provides routines for solving systems of
simultaneous linear equations, least-squares solutions of linear systems of
equations, eigenvalue problems, and singular value problems. The associated
matrix factorizations (LU, Cholesky, QR, SVD, Schur, generalized Schur) are
also provided, as are related computations such as reordering of the Schur
factorizations and estimating condition numbers. Dense and banded matrices are
handled, but not general sparse matrices. In all areas, similar functionality
is provided for real and complex matrices, in both single and double precision.

// If you're uncertain of the LAPACK routine name to address your application's
// needs, check out the LAPACK Search Engine.

The original goal of the LAPACK project was to make the widely used EISPACK and
LINPACK libraries run efficiently on shared-memory vector and parallel
processors. On these machines, LINPACK and EISPACK are inefficient because
their memory access patterns disregard the multi-layered memory hierarchies of
the machines, thereby spending too much time moving data instead of doing
useful floating-point operations. LAPACK addresses this problem by reorganizing
the algorithms to use block matrix operations, such as matrix multiplication,
in the innermost loops. These block operations can be optimized for each
architecture to account for the memory hierarchy, and so provide a
transportable way to achieve high efficiency on diverse modern machines. We use
the term "transportable" instead of "portable" because, for fastest possible
performance, LAPACK requires that highly optimized block matrix operations be
already implemented on each machine.

LAPACK routines are written so that as much as possible of the computation is
performed by calls to the Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS).
// While LINPACK and EISPACK are based on the vector operation kernels of the
// Level 1 BLAS, 
LAPACK is designed at the outset to exploit the Level 3 BLAS -- a set of
specifications for Fortran subprograms that do various types of matrix
multiplication and the solution of triangular systems with multiple right-hand
sides. Because of the coarse granularity of the Level 3 BLAS operations, their
use promotes high efficiency on many high-performance computers, particularly
if specially coded implementations are provided by the manufacturer.

Highly efficient machine-specific implementations of the BLAS are available for
many modern high-performance computers. For details of known vendor- or
ISV-provided BLAS, consult the BLAS FAQ. Alternatively, the user can download
ATLAS to automatically generate an optimized BLAS library for the architecture.
A Fortran 77 reference implementation of the BLAS is available from netlib;
however, its use is discouraged as it will not perform as well as a specifically
tuned implementation.

== Software

===  Licensing

LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It is available from netlib via
anonymous ftp and the World Wide Web at http://www.netlib.org/lapack . Thus, it
can be included in commercial software packages (and has been). We only ask
that proper credit be given to the authors.

The license used for the software is the modified BSD license, see:

- link:LICENSE.txt[LICENSE]

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the
following:

- If you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change the name of
the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

- We will gladly answer any questions regarding the software. If a modification
is done, however, it is the responsibility of the person who modified the
routine to provide support.

=== LAPACK for Windows

LAPACK is built under Windows using link:http://www.cmake.org[Cmake] the cross-platform, open-source build system.
The new build system was developed in collaboration with Kitware Inc. 

A dedicated website (http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-for-windows/lapack) is available for Windows users.

- You will find information about your configuration need.

- You will be able to download BLAS, LAPACK, LAPACKE pre-built libraries.

=== PLASMA
The Parallel Linear Algebra for Scalable Multi-core Architectures (PLASMA)
project aims to address the critical and highly disruptive situation that is
facing the Linear Algebra and High Performance Computing community due to the
introduction of multi-core architectures.

PLASMA's ultimate goal is to create software frameworks that enable programmers
to simplify the process of developing applications that can achieve both high
performance and portability across a range of new architectures.

The development of programming models that enforce asynchronous, out of order
scheduling of operations is the concept used as the basis for the definition of
a scalable yet highly efficient software framework for Computational Linear
Algebra applications.

=== MAGMA
The MAGMA (Matrix Algebra on GPU and Multicore Architectures) project aims to
develop a dense linear algebra library similar to LAPACK but for
heterogeneous/hybrid architectures, starting with current "Multicore+GPU"
systems.

The MAGMA research is based on the idea that, to address the complex challenges
of the emerging hybrid environments, optimal software solutions will themselves
have to hybridize, combining the strengths of different algorithms within a
single framework. Building on this idea, we aim to design linear algebra
algorithms and frameworks for hybrid manycore and GPUs systems that can enable
applications to fully exploit the power that each of the hybrid components
offers.
