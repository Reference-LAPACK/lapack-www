Edward Anderson stated in his paper https://doi.org/10.1145/3061665:

The square root of a sum of squares is well known to be prone to overflow and underflow. Ad hoc scaling
of intermediate results, as has been done in numerical software such as the BLAS and LAPACK, mostly
avoids the problem, but it can still occur at extreme values in the range of representable numbers. More
careful scaling, as has been implemented in recent versions of the standard algorithms, may come at the
expense of performance or clarity. This work reimplements the vector 2-norm and the generation of Givens
rotations from the Level 1 BLAS to improve their performance and design. In addition, support for negative
increments is extended to the Level 1 BLAS operations on a single vector, and a comprehensive test suite
for all the Level 1 BLAS is included.

This contribution replaces the original xNRM2, xROTG, xLARTG, xLASSQ routines with Edward's safe scaling codes plus some minor modifications.

Note: this code follows Fortran90 standard



2.2. Implementation of the multishift QZ algorithm with AED
------------------------------------------------------------
Contribution by link:https://github.com/thijssteel[thijssteel]

It is loosely based on my implementation of the *rational QZ algorithm* (https://github.com/thijssteel/multishift-multipole-rqz).

It features:

 - Agressive early deflation
 - Multishift QZ sweeps using optimal packing of the bulges
 - A new heuristic to select the number of positions in the sweep windows

It does not feature:

 - A windowed deflation of infinite eigenvalues (that is only useful if many infinite eigenvalues are to be deflated and in that case you should probably do some preprocessing anyway).
All things considered this won't significantly reduce the runtime of generalised schur form calculations because the HT reduction is now dominant, but I hope be able to have a really fast implementation of that soon.


Also *two accuracy improvements to xtgex2*:

 - Daan Camps has proven in his dissertation that replacing the condition in xtgex2 when swapping 1x1 blocks can improve the accuracy. This condition and the respective error tolerances have been changed to reflect it.

 - Also by Daan Camps, "SWAPPING 2 × 2 BLOCKS IN THE SCHUR AND GENERALIZED
SCHUR FORM", shows that the accuracy of swapping 2x2 blocks can be improved by iterative refinement and by replacing the QR factorisation with an SVD based method. This PR only implements the first improvement as the paper does not mention how to avoid overflow.
