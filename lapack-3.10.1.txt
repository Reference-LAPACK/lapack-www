2.1. Principal Bug fixes
-------------------------


.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/657[657]: Fix workspace size returned by getsls

**Description:** Make least squares solver getsls work as a drop-in replacement of gels
 - [dz]getsls: cast workspace size with dble, not real
 - Move workspace write to precede xerbla. Follow the documentation and return the optimal workspace in work(1) even on quick return

Clean up unused variables.

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/654[654], https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/656[656], https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/646[646]: Fix some argument checks

**Description:** Various argument check and typo corrections

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/angsch[angsch]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/649[649]: Fix a bug in the Blue's scaling constants

**Description:** Fixes a bug in the Blue's scaling constants of nrm2 thanks to Arm Performance Libraries!
This is the same bug fixed on #559 for la_constants.f90.

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/weslleyspereira[Weslley S. Pereira]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/638[638]: Fix workspace query of xGEQRF and xGERQF

**Description:** xGEQRF and xGERQF return wrong optimal dimension LWORK when M and N equals zero, respectively. This applies the fixes proposed by @andreasvarga and @VasileSima4 in https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/633[PR
#633].

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/andreasvarga[Andreas Varga] and https://github.com/VasileSima4[Vasile Sima]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/625[625]: Fix out of bounds read in xLARRV which resolves CVE-2021-4048

**Description:** See https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4048[CVE-2021-4048]

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/Keno[Keno Fischer]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/624[624]: Fix use of 8-byte integers on Windows

**Description:** CBLAS and LAPACKE layers are not built with 8 byte integers when cmake option BUILD_INDEX64=ON is passed.
The reason is because long's in windows are 4 bytes (MSVC c/c++, intel compilers). This patch uses int64_t and int32_t
to ensure ILP interface is built.

Additionally, this patch adds support ifort's 8 byte integer flag to cmake system for building BLAS and LAPACK.

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/621[621]: Fix support to IBM XL Fortran compiler

**Description:** This PR addresses https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/606[Issue #606], by adding correct detection for the IBM XL Fortran (xlf) recursive option (-qrecur).

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/quellyn[QuellynSnead]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/617[617]: Fix use of integer64 flag for Cray and NVIDIA Fortran compilers

**Description:** use default64 flag for Cray ftn compiler when BUILD_INDEX64 is ON.

**Contribution by:** https://github.com/ajaypanyala[Ajay Panyala]

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/607[607]: Fix xLAPY2 and xLAPY3 for infinity inputs

**Description:** If some of the inputs are inf, {s,d}lapy{2,3} and the new {s,d}nrm2 routines return inconsistent results, NaN in contrast to inf.

 - lapy2 if both inputs are inf
 - lapy3 if at least one of the 3 inputs is inf

This commit adds a check to avoid the divisions inf / inf that introduce NaN.

.Pull Request https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/605[605]: Fix workspace computation for GESDD routines

**Description:** There is a known bug in LAPACK related to workspaces smaller than the value computed by the routine. This is because the routines use a floating-point variable to return the integer workspace size. See https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/600[Issue #600]. The intent here is to mitigate the problem of overestimating the workspace when doing the conversion INTEGER -> REAL (or DOUBLE PRECISION) highlighted in #600. I do not solve the problem of a possible overflow in LWORK.

This PR applies the same strategy from the MAGMA package to solve the issue (See https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/600#issuecomment-884426097[Isse #600 (comment) from @mgates3]).

2.6 Notes about compiler dependency
-----------------------------------

Some LAPACK routines rely on trustworthy complex division and ABS routines in the FORTRAN compiler.
This [link](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/files/6672436/complexDivisionFound.txt) lists the LAPACK COMPLEX*16 algorithms that contain compiler dependent complex divisions of the form

     REAL / COMPLEX   or   COMPLEX / COMPLEX

See link:https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/575[Issue #575] and link:https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/577[Issue #577] for a more complete discussion on this topic.
