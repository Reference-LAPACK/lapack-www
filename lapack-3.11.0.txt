This is a major release and also addressing multiple bug fixes.

2.1. Normwise criterion for infinite eigenvalues in the QZ algorithm by https://github.com/thijssteel[@thijssteel]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The normwise criterion is more robust at detecting infinite eigenvalues than the elementwise criterion (link:https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/698[PR #698]). See also https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02057.


2.2 level-3 BLAS solvers for the triangular system and triangular Sylvester equations by https://github.com/angsch[@angsch]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The triangular Sylvester equation has been recognized to be prone to overflow. For that purpose, `*TRSYL` utilizes a scaling factor to represent the solution as `(s^{-1} X)` and solve the scaled equation `AX + XB = s C`. Due to the scaling factor, there is some flexibility in the representation of the solution. The proposed level-3 BLAS version computes the scaling factors based on the upper bounds of blocks to enable level-3 BLAS. The scaling is typically slightly more aggressive so that an alternatively scaled final solution is computed. This is no problem as long as the scaling factor does not get flushed to zero (https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/651[PR #651]). The same upper bound calculation was used to write the level-3 BLAS solver for the triangular system, `*LATRS3`.

2.3 Givens rotations generated with less accumulation error by https://github.com/weslleyspereira[@weslleyspereira]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New algorithms for computing Givens rotations in complex arithmetic that reduce the accumulation errors for computing each of the outputs, `c, s, r`. The new algorithms are, on average, more accurate than both the algorithms from LAPACK 3.9.1 and LAPACK 3.10.0 (https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/631[PR #631]). See also https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04010.

2.4 Faster algorithms for Least Squares by https://github.com/scr2016[@scr2016]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The new algorithms, `*GELST`, are similar to `*GELS`. `*GELST` avoids computing triangular blocks twice as in `*GELS`, which means `*GELST` runs faster (https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/739[PR #739]).
