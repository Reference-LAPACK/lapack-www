= Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD)

* xGEDMD computes the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for a pair of data snapshot matrices. For the input matrices X and Y such that Y = A*X with an inaccessible matrix A, xGEDMD computes a certain number of Ritz pairs of A using the standard Rayleigh-Ritz extraction from a subspace of range(X) that is determined using the leading left singular vectors of X. Optionally, xGEDMD returns the residuals of the computed Ritz pairs, the information needed for a refinement of the Ritz vectors, or the eigenvectors of the Exact DMD.
* xGEDMDQ does the same as xGEDMD but uses a QR factorization based compression of the data.
* See: Z. Drmac: A LAPACK implementation of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition I. Technical report. AIMDyn Inc. and LAPACK Working Note 298.
* Developed and coded by Zlatko Drmac, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb. In cooperation with AIMdyn Inc., Santa Barbara, CA. And supported by (1) DARPA SBIR project "Koopman Operator-Based Forecasting for Nonstationary Processes from Near-Term, Limited Observational Data", Contract No: W31P4Q-21-C-0007; (2) DARPA PAI project "Physics-Informed Machine Learning Methodologies", Contract No: HR0011-18-9-0033; (3) DARPA MoDyL project "A Data-Driven, Operator-Theoretic Framework for Space-Time Analysis of Process Dynamics", Contract No: HR0011-16-C-0116.

Distribution Statement A: Approved for Public Release, Distribution Unlimited. Cleared by DARPA on September 29, 2022
* Adding Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) into LAPACK by https://github.com/dbielich[@dbielich] in https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/736[PR 736]
* Update C prototypes and LAPACKE interfaces for ?GEDMD/?GEDMDQ by https://github.com/martin-frbg[@martin-frbg] in https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/pull/880[PR 880]

= Truncated QR with Column Pivoting

* The routine computes a truncated (rank K) or full rank Householder QR factorization with column pivoting of a real M-by-N matrix A using Level 3 BLAS.
* The truncation criteria (i.e. when to stop the factorization) can be any of the following: (1) The input parameter KMAX, the maximum number of columns KMAX to factorize; (2) The input parameter ABSTOL, the absolute tolerance for the maximum column 2-norm of the residual matrix R22(K); (3) The input parameter RELTOL, the tolerance for the maximum column 2-norm matrix of the residual matrix R22(K) divided by the maximum column 2-norm of the original matrix A, which is equal to abs(R(1,1)).  The algorithm stops when any of these conditions is first satisfied, otherwise the whole matrix A is factorized.

= Reciprocal Scaling of complex vectors

* [C/Z]RSCL multiplies an n-element complex vector x by the complex scalar 1/a. This is done without overflow or underflow as long as the final result x/a does not overflow or underflow.
* See: "An algorithm for scaling vectors by the reciprocal of a complex number", Weslley da Silva Pereira, [arXiv:2311.05736](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05736)
