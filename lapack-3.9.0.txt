2.2 LAPACK Householder Reconstruction
-------------------------------------

 NEW: cunhr_col.f
 NEW: dorhr_col.f
 NEW: sorhr_col.f
 NEW: zunhr_col.f

DORHR_COL takes an M-by-N real matrix Q_in with orthonormal columns as input, stored in A, and performs Householder Reconstruction (HR), i.e. reconstructs Householder vectors V(i) implicitly representing another M-by-N matrix Q_out, with the property that Q_in = Q_out*S, where S is an N-by-N diagonal matrix with diagonal entries equal to +1 or -1. The Householder vectors (columns V(i) of V) are stored in A on output, and the diagonal entries of S are stored in D.
Block reflectors are also returned in T (same output format as DGEQRT).

 NEW: CUNGTSQR.f
 NEW: DORGTSQR.f
 NEW: SORGTSQR.f
 NEW: ZUNGTSQR.f

DORTSQR reconstructs a matrix with orthonormal columns from the output of DLATSQR.
