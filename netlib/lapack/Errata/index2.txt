== [red]*bug0061* :: zgehrd.f is overflowing 
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report by Victor Liu on Tuesday August 03rd, 2010
 * zgehrd.f is overflowing  the maximum size in bytes of the largest array that
 * can be put on the stack with gfortran (=> leads ,e.g., to non-reproducible and uncorrect execution
 * of zgeev in multithreaded context
 * lapackers involved in the bug fix process: Julie and Julien Langou and Mathieu Faverge
 * bug fix by Victor Liu on Wednesday August 04th, 2010
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1930[forum topic 1930]
 * two outstanding issues: (1) how do we go to fix this?, (2) more LAPACK subroutines might be concerned.

== [red]*bug0057* :: Non-eigenvectors from DGEEV, problem in balancing
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Numpy team on April 22nd, 2010
 * see link:https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1818[forum topic 1818]
 * see follow-up on lapackers on April 22nd from Jim "bug in DGEHRD"
    "The balancing is choosing to scale some rows/columns by factors like 1e18,
which rather amplifies tiny rounding errors in the (presumably correctly)
computed eigenvectors of the balanced matrix, when balancing is undone at the end.
The expert driver interface dgeevx would let the user disable balancing, until
we figure out whether this is a bug or a feature, I'm not sure which."

== [red]*bug0056* ::  Non-orthogonal eigenvectors returned from DSYEVR
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Scipy team on April 22nd
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/archives/lapack/msg00874.html[ LAPACK Mailing list msg 874]
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011
 * " I can reproduce similar problems that the user encountered with non-orthogonal eigenvectors when only
 * a few eigenvalues are requested.  This also happens with SSYEVR.  If I set ABSTOL to SLAMCH('Safe minimum'),
 * the problem goes away in SSYEVR, and improves with DSYEVR but does not completely go away."
 
== [red]*bug0033* :: failure of zheevd on a specific matrix
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Cezary Sliwa (Instytut Fizyki PAN, Poland) on Thu 2 Jul 2009 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
 * see link:020.f[Cezary Sliwa's test code], link:021.dat[Cezary Sliwa's matrix], and
      link:022.txt[Cezary Sliwa's email].
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011

== [red]*bug0032* :: matrix splitting problem with dstebz and sstebz
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Phil DeMier (IBM) on Mon 29 Jun 2009 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
      "matrix splitting problem with dstebz and sstebz"
 * see link:018.txt[Phil DeMier's email] and link:019.f[Phil DeMier's test code]
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011
