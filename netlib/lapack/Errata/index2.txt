== [orange] *bug110* :: possible infinite loop in ZLARTG when input vector has NaN
* *REPORTED*, NEEDS TO BE VERIFIED
* Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
* Bug report by Mark Hoemmen and Jack Poulson
* See http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=3267&p=9067
* Mark Hoemmen writes: Jack Poulson found that ZLARTG has an infinite loop related
  to NaN .EQ. 0. It's the line below "ELSE IF( SCALE.LE.SAFMN2 )" between 10 and
  20. When G is NaN, then the loop goes forever.
  

== [green]*bug0109* ::  [xDRVRFP] Test was failing
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1425
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Hong Xu (INTEL) on July 21st
 * Patch sent by Hong Xu (INTEL)
 * In the input parameter checking, LDZ was not checked correctly
 * LDZ was checked against M instead of N essentially
 * Corrected by Julien on July 22 2013

== [green]*bug0108* ::  [xDRVRFP] Test was failing
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1416
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Elena Ivanova (INTEL)
 * Patch sent by Elena Ivanova (INTEL)
 * add MAX() to ensure index is at least 1
 * Corrected by Rodney on June 27 2013

== [green]*bug0107* ::  [CSD routines] fixed array index problems
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1414
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * add MAX() to ensure index is at least 1
 * this fixes array bounds violations in the test suite when array bounds checking is enabled
 * Corrected by Rodney on June 04 2013

== [green]*bug0106* ::  [xGEBAL] very large backward error for certain Hessenberg matrices (Watkins)
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1413
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report on the forum topic 4221
 * Patch sent by bmoloney
 * Now using 2-norm to compute vector norms of row and column for balancing algorithm.
 * This seems to fix problems with balancing causing very large backward error for certain
 * Hessenberg matrices, including the often cited example of Watkins.
 * Corrected by Rodney on May 26 2013

== [green]*bug0105* ::  [LAPACKE] lapacke.h problem
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1388
 * Present in LAPACKE 3.4.2
 * bug report on the forum topic 4221
 * Patch sent by bmoloney
 * A few C++ library includes are inside of the 'extern C block which causes many template with C 
 * linkage errors when the header is included in a C++ file.
 * Corrected by Julie on April 03 2013

== [green]*bug0104* :: dgeqp3 fall over when asked to do a factorization of the last two columns.
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1385
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Tyrone Rees (STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) on March 22 2013
 * Patch sent by Tyrone Rees
 * Corrected by Rodney on March 22 2013

== [green]*bug0103* :: [dlasd4/slasd4] fixes bug where TAU2 can be uninitialized.
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1384
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Sergey Kuznetsov (INTEL) on March 15 2013
 * Patch sent by Sergey Kuznetsov
 * Corrected by Rodney on March 22 2013
 
== [green]*bug0102* :: convergence problem with some particular pencils in xGGEV
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1351
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Mathworks on October 19 2012
 * Patch sent by Mathworks
 * Corrected by Rodney on Thu Oct 19

== [green]*bug0101* :: [S,D, C, Z]hsein: NaN in H can cause an infinite loop
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1350
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Alexander Kobotov (INTEL) on October 3 2012
 * See link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3928[forum topic 3928]
 * added check for NaN after the norm of each block of H is computed
 * if NaN is detected, returns with INFO=-6 (H is the 6th parameter)
 * Corrected by Rodney on Thu Oct 11

== [red]*bug0061* :: zgehrd.f is overflowing 
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report by Victor Liu on Tuesday August 03rd, 2010
 * zgehrd.f is overflowing  the maximum size in bytes of the largest array that
 * can be put on the stack with gfortran (=> leads ,e.g., to non-reproducible and uncorrect execution
 * of zgeev in multithreaded context
 * lapackers involved in the bug fix process: Julie and Julien Langou and Mathieu Faverge
 * bug fix by Victor Liu on Wednesday August 04th, 2010
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1930[forum topic 1930]
 * two outstanding issues: (1) how do we go to fix this?, (2) more LAPACK subroutines might be concerned.

== [red]*bug0057* :: Non-eigenvectors from DGEEV, problem in balancing
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Numpy team on April 22nd, 2010
 * see link:https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1818[forum topic 1818]
 * see follow-up on lapackers on April 22nd from Jim "bug in DGEHRD"
    "The balancing is choosing to scale some rows/columns by factors like 1e18,
which rather amplifies tiny rounding errors in the (presumably correctly)
computed eigenvectors of the balanced matrix, when balancing is undone at the end.
The expert driver interface dgeevx would let the user disable balancing, until
we figure out whether this is a bug or a feature, I'm not sure which."

== [red]*bug0056* ::  Non-orthogonal eigenvectors returned from DSYEVR
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Scipy team on April 22nd
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/archives/lapack/msg00874.html[ LAPACK Mailing list msg 874]
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011
 * " I can reproduce similar problems that the user encountered with non-orthogonal eigenvectors when only
 * a few eigenvalues are requested.  This also happens with SSYEVR.  If I set ABSTOL to SLAMCH('Safe minimum'),
 * the problem goes away in SSYEVR, and improves with DSYEVR but does not completely go away."
 
== [red]*bug0033* :: failure of zheevd on a specific matrix
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Cezary Sliwa (Instytut Fizyki PAN, Poland) on Thu 2 Jul 2009 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
 * see link:020.f[Cezary Sliwa's test code], link:021.dat[Cezary Sliwa's matrix], and
      link:022.txt[Cezary Sliwa's email].
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011

== [red]*bug0032* :: matrix splitting problem with dstebz and sstebz
 * *CONFIRMED*
 * bug report sent by Phil DeMier (IBM) on Mon 29 Jun 2009 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
      "matrix splitting problem with dstebz and sstebz"
