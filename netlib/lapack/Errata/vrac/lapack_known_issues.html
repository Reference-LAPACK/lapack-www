Bobby Cheng sent the lapackers the Mathworks patch to fix LAPACK QZ. This
patch works fine on the pencils (A1,B1) and (A2,B2). But fails on pencil
(A3,B3). As observed by Jim Demmel, matlab qz works fine with pencil (A3,B3).

Hi,

below are some comments on Mathworks' modifications to DGEBAL and DHGEQZ.

I support the point of view taken by Mathworks. Changing SCLFAC from 8 to
2 may result in a few extra iterations of the balancing algorithm, but it
may also give a balanced matrix of slightly smaller norm and consequently
one or two more accurate digits in the computed eigenvalues.
I am not aware that the execution time needed by balancing could be a
major concern when solving nonsymmetric eigenvalues.

</font>


As far as I can see, Mathworks applied four changes to *HGEQZ (not all of
them are marked in the code):

(1) Exceptional shift strategy

As also pointed out by Vasile Sima, the exceptional shift strategy for the
QZ algorithm currently implemented in DHGEQZ seems to be less effective
than the one for the QR algorithm. For example, it fails for the matrix
pair

     [ 0 0 0 1 ]
     [ 1 0 0 0 ]
A =  [ 0 1 0 0 ],  B = identity.
     [ 0 0 1 0 ]

LAPACK's exceptional shift is zero (this is the same as the standard shift
-> no convergence). Mathworks' exceptional shift is one (much better).

(2) Choice of single real shift

DHGEQZ applies a single shift QZ algorithm if the computed shifts are
real. This seems to be a relict of Ward's combination shift QZ algorithm,
which has no meaningful purpose anymore (applying two single shift QZ
iterations is more expensive than applying one double shift QZ iteration,
even in terms of flops).

If two real shifts are computed, Mathworks' change has the effect that
always the shift closer to the last diagonal element of A\B is used. If I
remember correctly, this is in the spirit of what Wilkinson proposed for
symmetric matrices. I support this change and expect that it can lead to
slightly faster convergence.

(3) Mathworks included B22 = -B22 on line 820 (in DHGEQZ)

This is a bug fix and I highly recommend to include it. It seems that
DHGEQZ computes wrong complex conjugate eigenvalue pairs if DLASV2
computes negative diagonal elements (I am not sure whether this is an
unlikely event in the context of the QZ algorithm).

(4) Mathworks uses the workspace to store the number of iterations
     needed for each eigenvalue.

This is probably used for debugging and should not be included in LAPACK.

As announced at the Householder meeting, Bo Kagstrom and I are currently
working on an extension of Ralph Byers' multishift aggressive QR code to
QZ. This code will take the modifs of Mathworks into account. However, I
suggest to include these modifs (particularly (1) and (3)) already in the
next update of LAPACK.

With best regards,

Subject: [Lapackers] Re: [Fwd: Convergence failure of LAPACK's zggevx]

Dear Jim Demmel:

The reported problem does involve the Exceptional shifts in QZ. Changing the QZ 
exceptional shift to something similar to what I have advixed for real QR and 
real QZ does fix this particular bug report. In my version of zhgeqz.f lines 
603 read

          ELSE
*
*           Exceptional shift.  Chosen for no particularly good reason.
*
             ESHIFT = ESHIFT + DCONJG( ( ASCALE*A( ILAST-1, ILAST ) ) /
      $               ( BSCALE*B( ILAST-1, ILAST-1 ) ) )

After these lines, I added
             TEMP =
      $      ABS(ASCALE*A(ILAST-1,ILAST-2)/(BSCALE*B(ILAST-1,ILAST-1)))+
      $      ABS(ASCALE*A(ILAST  ,ILAST-1)/(BSCALE*B(ILAST-2,ILAST-2)))
             TEMP2 =
      $      ABS(ASCALE*A(ILAST-1,ILAST-2)/(BSCALE*B(ILAST-2,ILAST-2)))+
      $      ABS(ASCALE*A(ILAST  ,ILAST-1)/(BSCALE*B(ILAST-1,ILAST-1)))
             ESHIFT = DCMPLX(MIN(TEMP, TEMP2),0)

This changes the value of the shift, now set on line 616
             SHIFT = ESHIFT


Thank you for including me in this discussion.

Subject: Re: [Lapack] dggev fails on non-singular system

Hello,

   I have done some testing and I have found that the following
patch fixes all the 3x3 and 4x4 matrix systems that I found failures
on:

Replace (in dhgeqz.f):

     629             IF( ( DBLE( MAXIT )*SAFMIN )*ABS( H( ILAST-1, ILAST) ).LT.
     630      $          ABS( T( ILAST-1, ILAST-1 ) ) ) THEN
     631                ESHIFT = ESHIFT + H( ILAST-1, ILAST ) /
     632      $                  T( ILAST-1, ILAST-1 )
     633             ELSE
     634                ESHIFT = ESHIFT + ONE / ( SAFMIN*DBLE( MAXIT ) )
     635             END IF

with:

     629             IF( ( DBLE( MAXIT )*SAFMIN )*ABS( H( ILAST, ILAST-1) ).LT.
     630      $          ABS( T( ILAST-1, ILAST-1 ) ) ) THEN
     631                ESHIFT = ESHIFT + 0.736 * H( ILAST, ILAST-1 ) /
     632      $                  T( ILAST-1, ILAST-1 )
     633             ELSE
     634                ESHIFT = ESHIFT + ONE / ( SAFMIN*DBLE( MAXIT ) )
     635             END IF

The idea here is the following: in the previous code, its certainly
possible for H(ILAST-1,ILAST) to equal 0, in which case the test
will pass but ESHIFT will not be modified at all. I have just
replaced it with H(ILAST,ILAST-1) which is guaranteed not to be
zero, since its a subdiagonal element and the previous tests will
search for zeros on the subdiagonal. The 0.736 coefficient is
arbitrary - without it, I still found a small number of convergence
failures on 4x4 integer systems.

<a name="DQDS">
<p style="font-size:xx-large;"><b>
2 -- DQDS algorithm (useful to compute the singular values of a matrix)</a></li>
</b></p>

Cleve Moler reported that LAPACK DLASQ1 routine (called by DBDSQR when only the
singular values are needed) fails on the bidiagonal matrix: <a
href="set_Moler_200.c">set_Moler_200.c</a>. Osni Marques provided us with
DLASQ1-6 routines that passes the matrix.

<font color=#408080>

I have done some investigation to find out why the 200 by 200 matrix that Cleve
Moler sent to us weeks ago leads to a failure in Matlab's "norm". My
understanding is that "norm" resorts to LAPACK's dbdsqr, which in turn calls
dqds, i.e. dlasq1 (which calls dlasq2 etc), if only singular vectors are
desired. Indeed, LAPACK 3.1.1's dlasq1 returns INFO=2 (Matlab prints "Warning:
SVD did not converge at index = 2") for Cleve's matrix, meaning "current block
of Z not diagonalized after 30*N iterations (in inner while loop)". This is
related to the NBIG = 30*( N0-I0+1 ) limit that is set in dlasq2, where I0 and
N0 indicate the active (sub)matrix dlasq2 is dealing with. It starts with I0=1
and N0=N if there is no initial splitting; I0 and N0 may change later if
splittings occur.

These are my findings:

1) Contrary to what I had originally thought, LAPACK 3.1.1's dlasq2 does not
contain our last modifications, in particular a mechanism to reverse (flip) the
qd-array in some adverse situations. The lack of this mechanism may greatly
delay convergence. In fact, LAPACK 3.1.1's dqds works if we allow more than
30*N iterations: without flipping, convergence is achieved in 8073 iterations
(to achieve this I changed 30*N to 300*N). In contrast, the latest dqds that we
have produced works just fine on Cleve's matrix: convergence is achieved in 969
iterations. Interestingly, LAPACK 3.1.1 converges in 970 iterations if we first
flip Cleve's matrix (similarly, "norm" also works fine).

2) In the computation of shifts (by dlasq4), we have TTYPE.EQ.-6, i.e. "Case 6,
no information to guide us." This case is based on a variable G that is used
for the computation of the shift (S = G*DMIN). Modifications were performed in
the dqds routines to make them thread safe (by removing SAVE statements) but in
LAPACK 3.1.1 G seems to be set to zero too often. I am afraid that for a
sequence of TTYPE.EQ.-6 this may lead to shifts that are not so efficient.

My records indicate that I submitted our latest version of dqds for inclusion
in LAPACK on 07/11/06 but the changes have not been incorporated (LAPACK 3.1 is
dated 11/12/06, and LAPACK 3.1.1 is dated 02/26/07). In any case, I am sending
it attached so it can be compared with LAPACK 3.1.1's dqds. I am also attaching
Cleve's 200 by 200 matrix as well as its flipped form in case someone (in the
cc list) would like to experiment with them.

Cheers,

Osni
</font>

The reason for which Osni code is not in LAPACK is that Osni code fail on some
of the matrices in the LAPACK testing, for example: <a href="set_PB1_30.c">set_PB1_30.c</a>.

Indeed the double precision routines of Osni are fine, there are only a few problems 
with the single precision routines.

Current status: 
Hello lapackers,

I did not understand upfront what Bobby Cheng was saying with his:
"MATLAB switched back to the old algorithm and lost some speed."
So I asked Bobby Cheng for their files.

MathWorks simply have hacked xBDSQR so that they use the QR algorithm (they simply have commented the lines that call
DLASQ1). So they use QR even if they want only the singular values. Matlab does not use the dqds algorithm when computing
a norm for example.
