 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1535 (LAPACK), rev 1541 (LAPACKE)
* Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
* Bug report by Kevin Squire on LAPACK Mailing  - August 15th 2013
* From Kevin: We were following the recommendation for RWORK size calculation from the ZGESDD header here ( http://netlib.org/lapack/complex16/zgesdd.f), and were finding that when INFO='N', the size was insufficient, and generally led to a segmentation fault.
*  The current definition says that "If JOBZ = 'N', LRWORK >= 5*min(M,N)", but we found that the minimum size needed to be at least 7*min(M,N).  This was through experimentation and comparison with code from Numpy and Octave, so you may wish to verify this through the code.
*  Relevant Julia links:

 * corrected by Julie
 * In LAPACK 3.3 ?(SY/HE)SV are updated to use TRS2. The TRS2 requires WORK(N) to operate, whereas in SV requirements for LWORK just to be >=1. There is no any check in SV if LWORK>=N, the array WORK just passed as it is to TRS2. So if LWORK<N a crash could occur while executing TRS2 due to overuse of allocated workspace.
 * I guess for the case of LWORK<N just previsous Level2 based ?(SY/HE)TRS should be used.

 * The correct dimension is (M-R), in which R is the smallest of P, M-P, Q, and M-Q.
 * An M-by-M matrix is partitioned into a 2-by-2 block structure. The
 * dimensions of the blocks are P-by-Q, P-by-(M-Q), (M-P)-by-Q, and
 * (M-P)-by-(M-Q). IWORK is involved in the permutation of rows or
 * columns of these blocks, and it is the largest block, in terms of
 * number of rows or columns, that determines the size of IWORK.

 *  DGESVD does not perform a workspace query on worker
 *  functions such as DGELQF, but rather it hardwires in an assumption as
 *  to LQF's workspace requirements.  This means that if LQF is changed,
 *  GESVD breaks.  This actually happens in ATLAS, because we provide a

 * independent fix proposed by Zlatko Drmac on Tue Aug 24 2010
 * see forum topic 1953
 * The problem that was reported (with zero matrix) is caused by bad
      initialization to xLASSQ.  It should be ZERO, ONE and not ZERO, ZERO.
      With ZERO, ZERO, xLASSQ does not touch those variables in case of zero
      vector, leaving scaling at ZERO, and in the nonzero case the scaling is
      between ONE and SQRT(N). So, in case of zero vector, division by a
      variable that is normally bigger than ONE causes division by zero.
      This is change (i) below.
 * committed by Julie Langou (SVN revision r790, on Wed, Aug 25 2010)
 * changes from Zlatko:
     i)   In xgejsv.f and xgesvj.f input parameters SCALE and SUMSQ in xlassq.f
	  are now initially set as SCALE = ZERO, SUMSQ=ONE.  Setting them both
	  to zero (without carefully reading xlassq.f) caused problems with
          exactly zero columns.
      ii) There was a problem in the branch that computes only SIGMA and U of
	  a rank deficient matrix. The computed numerical rank (NR) was
	  incorrectly written as N in parameter lists of the corresponding
          calls.
     iii) In xgsvj0.f, xgsvj1.f testing the input parameters is changed to
          prevent unnecessarily negative INFO in some situations.
     iv)  Minor changes, renaming some variables etc.

 * *CORRECTED* - see svn r765

 * bug report and fix sent by Alexander Kobotov (Intel) on Wed, 23 June 2010 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
 * Root cause is wrong estimation of real workspace size in ZLALSA (on path zgelsd->zlalsd->zlalsa).
      It assumes that RWORK array length should be max( N, (SMLSZ+1)*NRHS*3 ), where SMLSIZ=25.
      But in fact the function calls zlals0 which requires RWORK to be ( K*(1+NRHS) + 2*NRHS ), 
      where K could be as large as number of columns in matrix A.
      The same is actual for CGELSD.

 * bug report sent by Kevin Wadleigh on Tue 29 Sep 2009 to "lapack@cs.utk.edu".
      "LAPACK routine ieeeck.f and compiler optimizations"
 * The LAPACK function IEEECK should be modified to keep compilers from optimizing away the line
      NAN6 = NAN5*0.0
      and replacing it by NAN6 = 0.0.
      I've seen this happen using two different compilers at their default level of optimization. However, using
      NAN6 = NAN5*ZERO
      as in the attached file keeps this from happening.

== [green]*bug0024* :: the notation A' is confusing for complex matrices. Does A' stand for A transpose of A Hermitian transpose?
 * *CORRECTED* - see svn r969, 966 and 965
 * reported by Clint Whaley early July 2009
 * LAPACK is not consistent in it use of the notation for transpose and Hermitian transpose.
 * The use of LAPACK A' is not consistent with the BLAS useage.
 * We note that the Matlab/Scilab/Octave convention is A' stands for
      "conjugate transpose" and A.' stands for "transpose".
 * In the Z routines, LAPACK uses the notation A' 669 times, it means "conjugate
      transpose" most of the time but it means "transpose" a few times (maybe
      10 times max, for BLAS-like routines). The notation A*H, A*T, A*N is
      used 549 times, The notation A^T, A^N, A^H 19 times. (This is just for
      the Z routines.)

== [green]*bugXXXX* Revert DLARFG to 3.1.0, move DLARFG to DLARFP and improved DLARFP
 * *CORRECTED* - see svn (r706, r707, r708, r710, r712, r713) + (r755) 
 * Bug reported by Pat Quillen (MathWorks)
 * The Householder reflector generation routine dlarfg (for double precision)
      has been changed in LAPACK-3.2 by dlarfp to generate nonnegative
      diagonal elements (on the diagonal of the R factor of a QR
      factorization).  There is an issue in the dlarfp subroutine in
      LAPACK-3.2. The bug report is from Pat Quillen from MathWorks, have
      participated in the bug fix: Pat Quillen, Jim Demmel, Sven Hammarling,
      Mark Hoemmen, Guillaume Revy, William Kahan, Julie Langou and Julien
      Langou.
 * Extensive work by Jim Demmel, Guillaume Revy, and William Kahan have
      revealed that the new Householder reflector that guarantees a positive
      diagonal of R in QR has two apparently unfixable drawbacks compared to
      the old reflector:
      1) the computed reflector can be less orthogonal by a factor of about 4,
         (Jim, Guillaume and William are not sure why.)
      2) this new routine is intrinsically more sensitive to over/underflow,
         this is now well understood, details are skipped here.
      None of these issues arise with the conventional Householder reflector.

 * So the decision is to

      1) Fix as much as possible the xLARFP routines. This was corrected by
         Julien (see (r706, r707, r708, r710, r712, r713)) based on Jim's idea.

      2) Back out the changes in LAPACK to go back to using the old reflector
	 (xlarfg) everywhere (e.g. in xGEQRF, xGEQR2, etc.).

      3) Keep the change that saves flops when u has lots of trailing zeros,
         since this is independently a good idea.

      4) Change the name from xLARFP to xLARFGP and introduce new QR routines
	 (xGEQRFP and xGEQR2P) that uses xlarfp to guarantee a new positive
         diagonal of R, for who needs it.

      5) This requires to adapt the test suites

      6) Note: only the QR routines have an xGEQRFP. While it seems that quite
         a few users care for QR factorization with nonnegative diagonal R. Noone
	 seemed to care for this feature on LQ, QL or RQ. So we have left out
         these routines.

       7) Steps 2 to 6 were done during r755 by Julie.
