Bugs corrected from 3.3.1 to 3.4.0
==================================

== [green]*bug0084* :: Bug Ming Gu
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug reported by Ming Gu (UC Berkeley) through Jim Demmel
 * LAPACK driver routine infected: All SVD solvers when asked for singular values only. (Pathological matrix only)
 * bug is present in LAPACK since 3.1.1 and in Matlab 2010a and 2010b
 * For very specific matrices (given by Ming Gu), the DQDS code converges much slower than expected. The algorithm converges for these matrices un many more iterations
 than the LAPACK maximum number of iterations allow.
 * bug fix: (1) increase the maximum number of iterations in xlasq2, (2) fall back on Demmel/Kahan algorithm in case of nonconvergence of dqds.

== [green]*bug0083* :: Bug in the testing of CHERFSX function
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug reported by omitrofa (Intel MKL team) on the LAPACK forum
 * see link:https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?t=2644[forum topic 2644]
 * Test of CHERFSX function doesn't work because there is an error in ../TESTING/LIN/cerrhex.f ( lines 284-330 ). This function uses the diagonal pivoting factorization of a Hermitian indefinite matrix instead of the diagonal pivoting factorization of a Hermitian indefinite packed matrix. When CHERFSX is included in conditional "IF( LSAMEN( 2, C2, 'HE' ) ) THEN " the test works.

== [green]*bug0082* :: [CZ]laed2 Memory problems when COMPZ=\'I' in DSTEDC 
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug reported by Edward Smyth (NAG)
 * Added IF statement to prevent potential out of range errors with "K+1" indices.
 * corrected by Rodney on Wed Jun 21th 2011

== [green]*bug0081* :: [SD]laed2 WORKSPACE size is wrong when NCVT = NRU = NCC = 0 
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug reported by Hatem Ltaief (KAUST)
 * Update Workspace requirement to 4*N because the routine call [SD]LASCL that requires a 4*N workspace.

== [green]*bug0080* :: [CZ]BDSQR WORKSPACE size is wrong when NCVT = NRU = NCC = 0 
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug reported by Hatem Ltaief (KAUST)
 * Update Workspace requirement to 4*N because the routine call [SD]LASCL that requires a 4*N workspace.

== [green]*bug0079* :: ILA[SDCZ]LR out of bound access in the DO LOOP for array A.
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug detected by Julie
 * Change DO LOOP condition and add a IF inside the DO LOOP
 * corrected by Rodney on Tue April 21th 2011

== [green]*bug0065* :: workspace queries not being used     
 * *CORRECTED*
 * bug report by Clint Whaley on October 27th, 2010
 *  DGESVD does not perform a workspace query on worker
 *  functions such as DGELQF, but rather it hardwires in an assumption as
 *  to LQF's workspace requirements.  This means that if LQF is changed,
 *  GESVD breaks.  This actually happens in ATLAS, because we provide a
 *  faster GELQF, which sometimes uses extra workspace.  For LAPACK itself,
 *  it represents extra dependencies that don't need to be there. 
 * corrected by Julie on Mon Nov 7th 2011

== [green]*bug0029* :: problem of WORKSPACE query with DSTEDC
