==================================

== [green]*bug0109* ::  [xDRVRFP] Test was failing
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1425
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Hong Xu (INTEL) on July 21st
 * Patch sent by Hong Xu (INTEL)
 * In the input parameter checking, LDZ was not checked correctly
 * LDZ was checked against M instead of N essentially
 * Corrected by Julien on July 22 2013

== [green]*bug0108* ::  [xDRVRFP] Test was failing
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1416
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Elena Ivanova (INTEL)
 * Patch sent by Elena Ivanova (INTEL)
 * add MAX() to ensure index is at least 1
 * Corrected by Rodney on June 27 2013

== [green]*bug0107* ::  [CSD routines] fixed array index problems
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1414
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * add MAX() to ensure index is at least 1
 * this fixes array bounds violations in the test suite when array bounds checking is enabled
 * Corrected by Rodney on June 04 2013

== [green]*bug0106* ::  [xGEBAL] very large backward error for certain Hessenberg matrices (Watkins)
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1413
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report on the forum topic 4221
 * Patch sent by bmoloney
 * Now using 2-norm to compute vector norms of row and column for balancing algorithm.
 * This seems to fix problems with balancing causing very large backward error for certain
 * Hessenberg matrices, including the often cited example of Watkins.
 * Corrected by Rodney on May 26 2013

== [green]*bug0105* ::  [LAPACKE] lapacke.h problem
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1388
 * Present in LAPACKE 3.4.2
 * bug report on the forum topic 4221
 * Patch sent by bmoloney
 * A few C++ library includes are inside of the 'extern C block which causes many template with C 
 * linkage errors when the header is included in a C++ file.
 * Corrected by Julie on April 03 2013

== [green]*bug0104* :: dgeqp3 fall over when asked to do a factorization of the last two columns.
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1385
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Tyrone Rees (STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) on March 22 2013
 * Patch sent by Tyrone Rees
 * Corrected by Rodney on March 22 2013

== [green]*bug0103* :: [dlasd4/slasd4] fixes bug where TAU2 can be uninitialized.

== [green]*bug0102* :: convergence problem with some particular pencils in xGGEV
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1351
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Mathworks on October 19 2012
 * Patch sent by Mathworks
 * Corrected by Rodney on Thu Oct 19

== [green]*bug0101* :: [S,D, C, Z]hsein: NaN in H can cause an infinite loop
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1350
 * Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
 * bug report by Alexander Kobotov (INTEL) on October 3 2012
 * See link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3928[forum topic 3928]
 * added check for NaN after the norm of each block of H is computed
 * if NaN is detected, returns with INFO=-6 (H is the 6th parameter)
 * Corrected by Rodney on Thu Oct 11
