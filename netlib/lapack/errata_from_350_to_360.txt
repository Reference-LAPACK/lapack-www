== [green]*bug111* ::  incorrect RWORK size for ZGESDD
* *CORRECTED*, rev 1535 (LAPACK), rev 1541 (LAPACKE)
* Present in LAPACK 3.4.2
* Bug report by Kevin Squire on LAPACK Mailing  - August 15th 2013
* From Kevin: We were following the recommendation for RWORK size calculation from the ZGESDD header here ( http://netlib.org/lapack/complex16/zgesdd.f), and were finding that when INFO='N', the size was insufficient, and generally led to a segmentation fault.
* The current definition says that "If JOBZ = 'N', LRWORK >= 5*min(M,N)", but we found that the minimum size needed to be at least 7*min(M,N).  This was through experimentation and comparison with code from Numpy and Octave, so you may wish to verify this through the code.

== [green]*bug0057* :: Non-eigenvectors from DGEEV, problem in balancing
* *CORRECTED*, rev 1413
 * bug report sent by Numpy team on April 22nd, 2010
 * see link:https://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1818[forum topic 1818]
 * see follow-up on lapackers on April 22nd from Jim "bug in DGEHRD"
    "The balancing is choosing to scale some rows/columns by factors like 1e18,
which rather amplifies tiny rounding errors in the (presumably correctly)
computed eigenvectors of the balanced matrix, when balancing is undone at the end.
The expert driver interface dgeevx would let the user disable balancing, until
we figure out whether this is a bug or a feature, I'm not sure which."

== [green]*bug0056* ::  Non-orthogonal eigenvectors returned from DSYEVR
 * *CORRECTED*, rev 1540
 * bug report sent by Scipy team on April 22nd
 * see link:http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/archives/lapack/msg00874.html[ LAPACK Mailing list msg 874]
 * Confirmed by Rodney on Tue, 17 Feb 2011
 * " I can reproduce similar problems that the user encountered with non-orthogonal eigenvectors when only
 * a few eigenvalues are requested.  This also happens with SSYEVR.  If I set ABSTOL to SLAMCH('Safe minimum'),
 * the problem goes away in SSYEVR, and improves with DSYEVR but does not completely go away."
