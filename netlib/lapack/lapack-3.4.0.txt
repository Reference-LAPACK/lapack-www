LAPACK 3.4
==========

Release date: Fr 11/11/11.

This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation
and the Department of Energy under Grant No. NSF-OCI-1032861, NSF-CCF-00444486,
NSF-CNS 0325873, NSF-EIA 0122599, NSF-ACI-0090127, DOE-DE-FC02-01ER25478,
DOE-DE-FC02-06ER25768.

LAPACK is a software package provided by Univ. of Tennessee, Univ. of
California, Berkeley, Univ. of Colorado Denver and NAG Ltd..


1. Support and questions:
-------------------------

http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/

2. LAPACK 3.4: What's new
-------------------------

  1. *xGEQRT: QR factorization (improved interface).* Contribution by Rodney
James (UC Denver). xGEQRT is analogous to xGEQRF with a modified interface which
enables better performance when the blocked reflectors need to be reused. The
companion subroutines xGEMQRT apply the reflectors.

  2. *xGEQRT3: recursive QR factorization.* Contribution by Rodney James (UC
Denver). The recursive QR factorization enables cache-oblivious and enables high
performance on tall and skinny matrices.
See reference <<1>> below.

  3. *xTPQRT: Communication-Avoiding QR sequential kernels.* Contribution by
Rodney James (UC Denver).  These subroutines are useful for updating a QR
factorization and are used in sequential and parallel Communication Avoiding
QR. These subroutines support the general case Triangle on top of Pentagon
which includes as special cases so-called Triangle on top of Triangle and
Triangle on top of Square. This is the right-looking version of the subroutines
and the subroutines are blocked. The T matrices and the block size are part of
the interface. The companion subroutines xTPMQRT apply the reflectors.

 4. *xSYSVK: LDLT with rook pivoting.* Contribution by Craig Lucas (University
of Manchester and NAG) and Sven Hammarling (NAG).  These subroutines enable
better stability than the Bunch-Kaufman pivoting scheme currently used in
LAPACK xSYSV solvers; also, the elements of L are bounded, which is important
in some applications.  The computational time of xSYSVK is slightly higher than
the one of xSYSV.
See reference <<2>> and <<3>> below. 

 5. *CMAKE build system.* We are striving to help our users install our
libraries seamlessly on their machines.  The CMAKE team contributed to our
effort to port LAPACK and ScaLAPACK under the CMAKE build system. Building
under Windows has never been easier. This also allows us to release dll for
Windows, so users no longer need a Fortran compiler to use LAPACK under
Windows.

 6. *Doxygen documentation.* LAPACK routine documentation has never been more
accessible. See http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/.

 7. *New website allowing for easier navigation.*

 8. *LAPACKE - Standard C language APIs for LAPACK.* Since LAPACK 3.3.0, LAPACK
includes new C interfaces. With the LAPACK 3.4.0 release, LAPACKE is directly
integrated within the LAPACK library and has been enriched by the full set of
LAPACK subroutines.

7. Install Procedure
--------------------
[IMPORTANT]
==============================================================
LAPACK-3.2 now requires a FORTRAN 90 compiler.
(Do not try to compile with g77 or other 77 compilers.)
==============================================================

7.1  XBLAS & extra precise refinement routines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[TIP]
==============================================================
To install the XBLAS you might try this:

     wget http://www.netlib.org/xblas/xblas.tar.gz
     tar xvf xblas.tar.gz
     cd xblas
     autoconf
     CC=gcc FC=gfortran ./configure
     m4 Makefile.m4 >Makefile
     make makefiles
     make

The XBLAS must be built with a Fortran compiler compatible to the one
used to build LAPACK.  We recommend using exactly the same Fortran
compiler for both the XBLAS and LAPACK.  If these instructions do not
work, see the INSTALL file in the XBLAS distribution for more
information.
==============================================================


7.2  Variants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      make variants
      make variants_testing

	Corresponding libraries created in SRC/VARIANTS/LIB:
		- LU Crout : lucr.a
		- LU Left Looking : lull.a
		- LU Sivan Toledo's Recursive as Iterative: lurec.a
		- QR Left Looking : qrll.a
		- Cholesky Right Looking : cholrl.a
		- Cholesky Top : choltop.a


These variants are compiled by default in the build process but they
are not tested by default.

Please refer to the README file in SRC/VARIANTS for more information.

8. Interface changes
--------------------

[WARNING]
==============================================================
There are interface changes from LAPACK versions 3.1 to 3.2 for routines:

    ZCGESV DLASQ3 DLASQ4 SLASQ3 SLASQ4

.contribution

New linear solvers that ``guarantee'' answers accurate to machine precision or
warn that the answer cannot be trusted based on computed error bounds. All but
extremely ill-conditioned problems fall into the first category.

.public interfaces

These interfaces are prototypes; they may change after user feedback.
The matrix types supported in this release are

1. GE (general)
2. SY (symmetric)
3. PO (positive definite)
4. HE (Hermitian)
5. GB (general band)

in real/complex and single/double precision versions. The driver routines are designated
-svxx, and the refinement routines -rfsx.  The testing codes for SY
and HE have not been integrated into the LAPACK distribution yet.

C     Purpose
C     =======
C
C     SGESVXX uses the LU factorization to compute the solution to a
C     real system of linear equations  A * X = B,  where A is an
C     N-by-N matrix and X and B are N-by-NRHS matrices.
C
C     If requested, both normwise and maximum componentwise error bounds
C     are returned. SGESVXX will return a solution with a tiny
C     guaranteed error (O(eps) where eps is the working machine
C     precision) unless the matrix is very ill-conditioned, in which
C     case a warning is returned. Relevant condition numbers also are
C     calculated and returned.
C
C     SGESVXX accepts user-provided factorizations and equilibration
C     factors; see the definitions of the FACT and EQUED options.
C     Solving with refinement and using a factorization from a previous
C     SGESVXX call will also produce a solution with either O(eps)
C     errors or warnings, but we cannot make that claim for general
C     user-provided factorizations and equilibration factors if they
C     differ from what SGESVXX would itself produce.

The auxiliary routines to apply Householder reflections (e.g. DLARFB)
automatically reduce the cost of QR from O(n^3^) to O(n^2^+nb^2^) for matrices
stored in a dense format for band matrices with bandwidth b with no user
interface changes.  Other users of these routines can see similar benefits in
particular on ``narrow profile'' matrices.

High accuracy SVD routine for dense matrices, which can compute tiny singular
values to many more correct digits than `SGESVD` when the matrix has columns
differing widely in norm, and usually runs faster than `SGESVD` too.

*SGESVJ* implements one-sided Jacobi SVD with fast scaled rotations and de
Rijk's pivoting. The code works as specified in the theory of Demmel and
Veselic. It uses a special implementation of Jacobi rotations, so that it can
compute the singular values in the full range [underflow, overflow].  `SGESVJ`
can be used as standalone, and it is also the kernel routine in the expert
driver routine `SGEJSV`.

C
C  Purpose
C  =======
C  DGESVJ computes the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a real
C  M-by-N matrix A, where M >= N. The SVD of A is written as
C                                     [++]   [xx]   [x0]   [xx]
C               A = U * SIGMA * V^t,  [++] = [xx] * [ox] * [xx]
C                                     [++]   [xx]
C  where SIGMA is an N-by-N diagonal matrix, U is an M-by-N orthonormal
C  matrix, and V is an N-by-N orthogonal matrix. The diagonal elements
C  of SIGMA are the singular values of A. The columns of U and V are the
C  left and the right singular vectors of A, respectively.
C
----

*SGEJSV* implements the preconditioned Jacobi SVD of Drmac and Veselic. This is
the expert driver routine that calls `SGESVJ` after certain preconditioning. In
keeping the standard type of accuracy it also delivers relatively accurate
singular values, including the smallest ones, if the matrix A can be diagonally
scaled so that the scaled matrix `C = A \* D` is well conditioned. The relative
accuracy is usually obtained on a broader class of matrices `A = D1 \* C \* D2`,
where `D1`, `D2` are arbitrary diagonal matrices and `C` is well conditioned.
The computational range for the singular values can be set as the full range
(underflow, overflow), provided that the BLAS and LAPACK routines called by
xGEJSV are implemented to work in that range.

The driver routine `SGEJSV` can be set to work safely in a restricted range,
meaning that the singular values of magnitude below `||A||_2 / SLAMCH(\'O\')` are
returned as zeros.  This means that the software complies with the theory as
long the condition number does not overflow.

RFP = Rectangular Full Packed.

Motivation for the RFP format: LAPACK current full formats (PO, TR, HE) waste
half of the memory, LAPACK current packed formats (PP, TP, HP) are
inefficient. In 2005 Gustavson introduced the rectangular full packed format
(PF, TF, HF) which enables the use of half the full storage while maintaining
efficiency by using Level 3 BLAS/LAPACK kernels.

The idea is simple: to store an N by N triangle (and suppose for simplicity
that N is even), partition the triangle into three parts: two N/2 by N/2
triangles and an N/2 by N/2 square, then pack this as an N by N/2
rectangle (or N/2 by N rectangle), by transposing (or transpose-conjugating)
one of the triangles and packing it next to the other triangle.  Since the two
triangles are stored in full storage (PO, TR, HE) one can use existing
efficient routines on them. They are some subtleties and variants, but
everything works fine. The storage format Gustavson has proposed has 8
possible cases depending whether N is odd or even, whether the matrix is upper or lower
triangular, and whether the user chooses to store
the conjugate-transpose of the storage or its normal form.

.storing a matrix in RFP format

1. The RFP format is not that hard to understand. We refer to the headers of
the routines, the paper in the reference above or an illustrative webpage
[http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~langou/lapack-3.2/rfp.html[URL-3]].

2. The routines `CHFRK`, `ZHFRK`, `SSFRK` and `DSFRK` directly build matrices
in RFP format. Once the matrix is constructed the user can then use it without
understanding the details of the format.

3. There are some conversion routines: `xTPTTF` goes from standard packed to 
RFP and `xTRTTF` goes from full to RFP. This approach is less interesting than
(1) or (2) since it requires the storage of two matrices.

   1. ZHFRK( )  Form the normal equations (maybe update them)
   2. ZPFTRF( ) Cholesky factorization of the normal equations
   3. ZPFTRS( ) Solve the normal equations

which performs the same operations as ZSYRK, ZPOTRF, ZPOTRS (with half the storage
for the normal equations).

[WARNING]
The current RFP routines can have `INTEGER` overflow since they access entries
like `A( N*N )` and `N*N` (for very large `N`) may not be representable
as a 32-bit `INTEGER`. (Note that the same restriction holds for any current LAPACK
packed routines). Use 64-bit `INTEGER` and you'll be covered.

The version of dqds available in LAPACK-3.1.1 (released in February 2007) is
essentially the version of dqds available in LAPACK-3.0 (released in 1999).

The difference between those two versions is that the dqds in LAPACK-3.1.1 is
thread safe.  Any eventual shortcomings of the dqds algorithm in LAPACK-3.0
are still present in LAPACK-3.1.1. In LAPACK-3.2.0, we introduce the latest
version of dqds that Beresford Parlett and Osni Marques produced in 2006.  This version
contained a number of improvements that were introduced after 1999. In
particular, the flipping mechanism has been improved. The original motivation
was a problem reported by one of Inderjit Dhillon's students (Univ. of Texas at
Austin). As a result, this new version of dqds (let us call it dqds-3.2)
passes the tests with Cleve Moler's matrix while dqds-3.0 and dqds-3.1 do not pass the tests with this
matrix.  The algorithm in dqds-3.0 and dqds-3.1 fails to converge in the
maximum number of iterations allowed. Cleve Moler's matrix is at
[http://www-math.cudenver.edu/\~langou/lapack-3.2/set_Moler_200.c[URL-1]].
The single precision version of the code dqds-3.2 has a problem in the LAPACK
TESTING with one of the matrices of type 16 while dqds-3.0 and dqds-3.1 were
fine. The matrix is at
[http://www-math.cudenver.edu/~langou/lapack-3.2/set_PB1_30.c[URL-2]].  To
pass this matrix, we needed to set the `IEEE` LOGICAL variable in SLASQ2 to
`.FALSE.`.  This is a temporary fix; we wish to have a better fix in the
future.

.contribution

Most of the revisions are fixing typographical errors, but there are a few
revisions that have a small affect on how the program works.  Even these are
relatively minor revisions:

  1. Revised the choice of the size of the deflation window slightly to make
     the code a little more robust against convergence failures.
  2. Revised the section of code that tries to reintroduce bulges after they
     have collapsed due to underflow.  The new version is cleaner and more
     robust.
  3. Revised `xLAQR1` so that it does not assume that `H(2,1)` is real.  A code
     ought to do what it claims to do and in the complex case, this small
     subroutine didn't quite do it.

.make xLARFT thread friendly
Take into account the comments of Robert van de Geijn (Univ. of Texas at
Austin) concerning the interface of xLARFT.  The interface labels V as
input/output and this is not at all convenient for multithreaded
implementations. xLARFT could be written in such a way that V is input
only. This impacts also the thread friendliness of ORMQR and alikes.

1. Change the default Cholesky factorization in SRC from right-looking to left-looking,
move left-looking to the VARIANTS directory.
2. Add some recursive variants for QR and Cholesky.
3. Remove IEEE=.FALSE. in DQDS (DLASQ3, SLASQ3 of Osni).
4. Remove the possibilities of INTEGER overflow in the RFP routines
5. Since we moved F90, remove xLAMCH by its FORTRAN INTRINSICs analoguous
