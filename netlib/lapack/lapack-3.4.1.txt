.contribution

Since LAPACK 3.3.0, LAPACK includes new C interfaces. With the LAPACK 3.4.0
release, LAPACKE is directly integrated within the LAPACK library and has been
enriched with the new set of LAPACK subroutines. See link:lapacke.html[here].

Headers and code have been cleaned up and some routines have been added. 

6.7.  CMAKE build system

.contribution

We are striving to help our users install our libraries seamlessly on their
machines.  The CMAKE team contributed to our effort to port LAPACK
under the CMAKE build system. LAPACKE integration has been improved, and support for
XLF compiler has been added.
With this release, we are releasing for Windows all dlls: reference BLAS, LAPACK and LAPACKE
Windows are now able to call LAPACKE directly form Visual Studio. (No Fortran involved!)
