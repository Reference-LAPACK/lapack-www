6. More details
----------------

 * *Modified all of the matrix norm routines*. Now, if a matrix contains a NaN, a NaN will be returned for all choices of norm.
 Previously, if a matrix contained a NaN, the norm routines would not return necessarily a NaN. (They would return regular floating-point numbers in some cases.)
