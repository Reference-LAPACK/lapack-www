6. More details
----------------

 *xSYSV_ROOK: LDL^T^ with rook pivoting.* Contribution by Craig Lucas (University
of Manchester and NAG) and Sven Hammarling (NAG).  These subroutines enable
better stability than the Bunch-Kaufman pivoting scheme currently used in
LAPACK xSYSV solvers; also, the elements of L are bounded, which is important
in some applications.  The computational time of xSYSV_ROOK is slightly higher than
the one of xSYSV.

 * more robust complex division routine [DLADIV]- suggested by Victor Liu <vkl@stanford.edu>
 contributed by Michael Baudin, Robert L. Smith

Robert L. Smith is actually the original inventor of the current algorithm in Lapack. I have attached my modified DLADIV routine, which passes all the tests in the build process.
