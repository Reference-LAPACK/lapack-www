 abstract     = "This paper is concerned with the distributed
                 parallel computation of an ordering for a symmetric
                 positive definite sparse matrix. The purpose of the
                 ordering is to limit fill and enhance concurrency in
                 the subsequent computation of the Cholesky
                 factorization of the matrix. We use a geometric
                 approach to nested dissection based on a given
                 Cartesian embedding of the graph of the matrix in
                 Euclidean space. The resulting algorithm can be
                 implemented efficiently on massively parallel,
                 distributed memory computers. One unusual feature of
                 the distributed algorithm is that its effectiveness
                 does not depend strongly on data locality, which is
                 critical in this context, since an appropriate
                 partitioning of the problem is not known until after
                 the ordering has been determined. The ordering
                 algorithm is the first component in a suite of
                 scalable parallel algorithms currently under

                 libraries for high performance computers. Particular
                 emphasis is placed on the development of scalable
                 algorithms for MIMD distributed memory concurrent
                 computers. A brief description of the EISPACK,
                 LINPACK, and LAPACK libraries is given, followed by
                 an outline of ScaLAPACK, which is a distributed
                 memory version of LAPACK currently under
                 development. The importance of block-partitioned
                 algorithms in reducing the frequency of data
                 movement between different levels of hierarchical
                 memory is stressed. The use of such algorithms helps
                 reduce the message startup costs on distributed
                 memory concurrent computers. Other key ideas in our
                 approach are the use of distributed versions of the
                 Level 3 Basic Linear Algebra Subgrams (BLAS) as
                 computational building blocks, and the use of Basic
                 Linear Algebra Communication Subprograms (BLACS) as
                 communication building blocks. Together the
                 distributed BLAS and the BLACS can be used to
                 construct higher-level algorithms, and hide many
                 details of the parallelism from the application
                 developer. The block-cyclic data distribution is
                 described, and adopted as a good way of distributing
                 block-partitioned matrices. Block-partitioned
                 versions of the Cholesky and LU factorizations are
                 presented, and optimization issues associated with
                 the implementation of the LU factorization algorithm
                 on distributed memory concurrent computers are
                 discussed, together with its performance on the
                 Intel Delta system. Finally, approaches to the
                 design of library interfaces are reviewed.",

 abstract     = "An attractive paradigm for building fast numerical
                 algorithms is the following: (1) try a fast but
                 occasionally unstable algorithm, (2) test the
                 accuracy of the computed answer, and (3) recompute
                 the answer slowly and accurately in the unlikely
                 event it is necessary. This is especially attractive
                 on parallel machines where the fastest algorithms
                 may be less stable than the best serial
                 algorithms. Since unstable algorithms can overflow
                 or cause other exceptions, exception handling is
                 needed to implement this paradigm safely. To
                 implement it efficiently, exception handling cannot

 abstract     = "Let $B$ be an $m\times n$ ($m\ge n$) complex matrix.
                 It is known that there is a unique {\em polar
                 decomposition} $B=QH$, where $Q^*Q=I$, the $n\times
                 n$ identity matrix, and $H$ is positive definite,
                 provided $B$ has full column rank. This paper
                 addresses the following question: how much may $Q$
                 change if $B$ is perturbed to $\widetilde
                 B=D_1^*BD_2$? Here $D_1$ and $D_2$ are two
                 nonsingular matrices and close to the identities of
                 suitable dimensions. Known perturbation bounds for
                 complex matrices indicate that in the worst case,
                 the change in $Q$ is proportional to the reciprocal
                 of the smallest singular value of $B$. In this
                 paper, we will prove that for the above mentioned
                 perturbations to $B$, the change in $Q$ is bounded
                 only by the distances from $D_1$ and $D_2$ to
                 identities! As an application, we will consider
                 perturbations for one-side scaling, i.e., the case
                 when $G=D^*B$ is perturbed to $\widetilde
                 G=D^*\widetilde B$, where $D$ is usually a
                 nonsingular diagonal scaling matrix but for our
                 purpose we do not have to assume this, and $B$ and
                 $\widetilde B$ are nonsingular.",
